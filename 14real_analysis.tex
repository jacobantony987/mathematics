\subsection{Properties of Monotone Functions}
\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be an increasing function defined on closed interval $[a,b]$.
	And let $x_0=a < x_1 < x_2 < \dots <x_{n-1} < x_n = b$.
	Then,
	\[ \sum_{k = 1}^{n-1} [f(x_k+)-f(x_k-)] \le f(b) - f(a) \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f$ be an increasing function on $[a,b]$.
	Let $\{x_0=a,\ x_1, \dots,\ x_n=b\}$ be a partition of $[a,b]$.
	Let $y_k \in (x_{k-1},x_k),\ \forall k$.
	Then, $f(y_k) \le f(x_k+)$ and $f(x_k-) \le f(y_{k-1})$.
	Therefore,
	\[ \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} [f(x_k+) - f(x_k-)] \le \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} [f(y_k) - f(y_{k-1})] \le f(b) - f(a) \]
\end{proof}
\begin{commentary}
	In other words, for monotonic functions the sum of jumps is bounded.
\end{commentary}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be a monotonic function defined on closed interval $[a,b]$.
	Then the set of discontinuities of $f$ is countable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Without loss of generality, let $f$ be an increasing function on $[a,b]$.
	Let $S_m$ be the set of all points on $[a,b]$ at which the jump exceeds $\frac{1}{m}$.\\

	We know that, the sum of jumps of an increasing function is bounded above by $f(b)-f(a)$.	
	Thus, cardinality of $S_m$ given by,
	\[ |S_m| < m[f(b)-f(a)] \]
	is finite for any positive integer $m$.\\

	If $f$ is discontinuous at a pont $x \in [a,b]$, then there exists some integer $m'$ such that $0 < \frac{1}{m'} < x $ and $x \in S_{m'}$.
	\[ \text{Number of discontinuities } = \left| \bigcup_{m=1}^\infty S_m \right| \le \sum_{m=1}^\infty |S_m| \text{ is countable.}\]
	since countable sum of finite values is countable.
	Therefore, the number of discontinuities of $f$ is countable.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Function of Bounded Variation}
\begin{definition}[partition]
	Let $[a,b]$ be a compact interval.
	Let $x_0 = a$, $x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < \dots < x_n$ and $x_n = b$.
	Then $P = \{ x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n \}$ is a \textbf{partition} of $[a,b]$.
	And $(x_{k-1},x_k)$ is the \textbf{$k$th subinterval} of the partition.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[bounded variation]
	Let $f$ be a function defined on closed interval $[a,b]$.
	If there exists a positive real-number $M$ such that
	\[ \sum_{k=1}^n |\Delta f_k| = \sum_{k=1}^n |f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})| \le M \]
	for any partition $P$ on $[a,b]$.
	Then $f$ is a function of \textbf{bounded variation}, where $(x_{k-1},x_k)$ is the $k$th subinterval of the partition.\\

\begin{commentary}
	In other words, a function is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ if the sum of variations is bounded for any (finite) partition of $[a,b]$.
\end{commentary}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be a monotonic function on $[a,b]$.
	Then $f$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Without loss of generality, let $f$ be an increasing function.
	Then for any partition $P = \{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ of $[a,b]$, we have
	\[ \sum_{k=1}^n \left[ f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1}) \right] \le f(b)-f(a) = M \]
	Therefore, $f$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$ and its derivative $f'$ exists and $f'$ is bounded in $(a,b)$.
	Then $f$ is of bounded variation.	
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f$ be a continuous function with derivative $f'$ on $(a,b)$.
	Since $f$ is continuous and $f'$ exists, from intermediate value theorem we have
	\[ \Delta f_k = f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1}) = f'(t_k) [x_k-x_{k-1}] \text{ where } t_k \in (x_{k-1},x_k) \]
	Since $f'$ is bounded, $f'(t_k) \le M'$ for any $t_k \in (a,b)$.
	Thus,
	\[ \sum_{k=1}^n |\Delta f_k| = \sum_{k=1}^n |f'(t_k)| (x_k-x_{k-1}) \le M'\sum_{k=1}^n x_k-x_{k-1} = M'(b-a) = M \]
	Therefore, $f$ is of bounded variation.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be a function on $[a,b]$.
	If $f$ is of bounded variation, then $f$ is bounded.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $x \in (a,b)$.
	Consider the partition $P = \{ a,x,b \}$.
	Since $f$ is of bounded variation, there exists a positive real-number $M$ such that
	\[ \sum_{k=1}^2 |\Delta f_k| = |f(x)-f(a)| + |f(b)-f(x)| \le M \]
	Clearly, $|f(x)-f(a)| \le M$, since $|f(b)-f(x)| > 0$.
	We have,
	\[ |f(x)| = |f(x)-f(a)+f(a)| \le |f(x)-f(a)|+|f(a)| \le M+|f(a)| \]
	Suppose $x = a$, then $|f(x)| = |f(a)|$.\\
	Suppose $x = b$, then $|f(x)| = |f(b)| = M' + |f(a)|$ where $M' = |f(b)|-|f(a)|$.\\

	Therefore, the function $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Total Variation}
\begin{definition}[total variation]
	Let $f$ be a function of bounded variation on $[a,b]$.
	Let $\Sigma (P)$ be the sum of variations with respect to the partition $P$ of $[a,b]$.
	Then the \textbf{total variation} of the function $f$ on $[a,b]$ is given by,
	\[ V_f(a,b) = V_f = \sup \{ \Sigma (P) : P \in \mathscr{P}[a,b] \} \]
\end{definition}
\textbf{Note 1} : $V_f$ is finite, since $f$ is of boundned variation on $[a,b]$.\\

\textbf{Note 2} : $V_f \ge 0$, since $|\Delta f_k| \ge 0$ for any subinterval of $[a,b]$.\\


\textbf{Note 3} : $V_f = 0$ if only if $f$ is a constant function on $[a,b]$. (Why ?)

\begin{theorem}
	Let $f,g$ be functions of bounded variation on $[a,b]$.
	Then their sum $f+g$, difference $f-g$, and product $fg$ are of bounded variation.
	Also, 
	\[ V_{f \pm g} \le V_f + V_g \quad \text{ and } \quad V_{fg} \le AV_f + BV_g \]
	where $\displaystyle A = \sup \left\{ |g(x)| : x \in [a,b] \right\}$ and $\displaystyle B = \sup \left\{ |f(x)| : x \in [a,b] \right\}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f,g$ be functions of bounded variation on $[a,b]$.
	Then $f,g$ are bounded and $\sup |f(x)|$ and $\sup |g(x)|$ exists.\\

	\textbf{Step 1 : $V_{f \pm g} \le V_f + V_g$}\\
	We have,
	\[ |(f+g)(x_k) - (f+g)(x_{k-1})| \le | f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})| + |g(x_k) - g(x_{k-1})| \]
	Then
	\begin{align*}
	V_{f+g}  
		& = \sup_{P \in \mathscr{P}} \sum_{k=1}^n |(f+g)(x_k) - (f+g)(x_{k-1})| \\
		& \le \sup_{P \in \mathscr{P}} \sum_{k=1}^n |f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})| + \sup_{P \in \mathscr{P}} \sum_{k=1}^n |g(x_k)-g(x_{k-1})| \\
		& = V_f + V_g 
\end{align*}
	Similarly, we have $V_{f-g} \le V_f + V_g$ since
	\[ |(f-g)(x_k) - (f-g)(x_{k-1})| \le |f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1})| + |g(x_k)-g(x_{k-1})| \]

	\textbf{Step 2 : $V_{fg} \le AV_f + BV_g$}\\
	We have,
	\begin{align*}
	|fg(x_k)-fg(x_{k-1})| 
		& = |f(x_k)g(x_k) - f(x_{k-1}g(x_{k-1})| \\
		& = |f(x_k)g(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})g(x_k) + f(x_{k-1}g(x_k) - f(x_{k-1}g(x_{k-1}) | \\
		& \le |g(x_k)|\ |f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1})| + |f(x_{k-1}|\ |g(x_k) - g(x_{k-1})| \\
		& \le A |f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1})| + B |g(x_k)-g(x_{k-1})|
	\end{align*}
	where $A = \sup \{ |g(x)| : x \in [a,b] \}$ and $B = \sup \{ |f(x)| : x \in [a,b] \}$.\\

	Therefore,
	\begin{align*}
	V_{fg} 
		& \le A \sup_{P \in \mathscr{P}} \left\{ \sum_{k=1}^n |f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1}| \right\} + B \sup_{P \in \mathscr{P}} \left\{ \sum_{k=1}^n |g(x_k)-g(x_{k-1})| \right\} \\
		& = AV_f + BV_g 
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[bounded away from zero]
	A function $f$ is bounded away from zero on $[a,b]$ if there exists a real-number $m$ such that $0 < m \le f(x)$, $\forall x \in [a,b]$.
\end{definition}

\begin{commentary}
	Let $f$ be a function of bounded variation.
	Then $\frac{1}{f}$ is of bounded variation if and only if $f$ is bounded away from zero.(Why ?)
\end{commentary}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be a function of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ and $f$ is bounded away from zero.
	Then, $g = \frac{1}{f}$ is a function of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ and $V_g \le \frac{V_f}{m^2}$ whenever $0 < m \le |f(x)|$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $f$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ and $f$ is bounded away from zero.
	That is, there exists positive real-number $m$ such that $0 < m \le |f(x)|$, $\forall x \in [a,b]$.
	Then, $\frac{1}{|f(x)|} \le \frac{1}{m}$, $\forall x \in [a,b]$.\\

	Define $g = \frac{1}{f}$.
	Then, we have
	\[ |\Delta g_k| = \left| \frac{1}{f(x_k)} - \frac{1}{f(x_{k-1})} \right| = \frac{|f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1})|}{|f(x_k)|\ |f(x_{k-1}|} \le \frac{|f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1})|}{m^2} \]
	The total variation of $g$ on $[a,b]$ is given by,
	\begin{align*}
	V_g 
		& = \sup_{P \in \mathscr{P}} \left\{ \sum_{k=1}^n |g(x_k)-g(x_{k-1})| \right\} \\
		& \le \frac{1}{m^2} \sup_{P \in \mathscr{P}} \left\{ \sum_{k=1}^n |f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1})| \right\} \\
		& \le \frac{V_f}{m^2} \text{ where } 0 < m \le |f(x)|,\ \forall x \in [a,b]
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\begin{commentary}
	In other words, if $h,f$ are functions of bounded variation of $[a,b]$.
	And $f$ is bounded away from zero, then $g = \frac{1}{f}$ and $\frac{h}{f} = hg$ is a function of bounded variation and $V_{\frac{h}{f}} = V_{hg} \le AV_h + BV_f$.\\

	Now, we have analyzed sum, difference, product and quotient of functions of bounded variation.
	And we are not surprised about preservation of bounded variation under function composition. (Why ?)
\end{commentary}
\subsection{Additive Property of Total Variation}
\begin{theorem}[additive property]
	Let $f$ be a function of bounded variation on $[a,b]$.
	Let $c \in (a,b)$.
	Then $f$ is of bounded variation on both $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$.
	And, $V_f(a,b) = V_f(a,c)+V_f(c,b)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f$ be a function of bounded variation on $[a,b]$.
	Let $P_1,P_2$ be partitions of $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$ respectively.
	Then $P_0 = P_1 \cup P_2$ is a partition of $[a,b]$.
	Thus,
	\[ \sum (P_1) + \sum (P_2) = \sum (P_0) \le V_f(a,b) \]
	Taking supremums on the left side, we get
	\[ V_f(a,c) + V_f(c,b) \le V_f(a,b) \]	
	Clearly, $V_f(a,c) \le V_f(a,b)$ and $V_f(c,b) \le V_f(a,b)$.
	Therefore, function $f$ is of bounded variation on both $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$.\\

	Let $P$ be a paritition of $[a,b]$.
	Then $P_0 = P\cup\{c\}$ is refinement of $P$.
	Now, we have two partitions $P_1, P_2$ of $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$ such that $P_0 = P_1 \cup P_2$.
	Thus,
	\[ \sum (P) \le \sum (P_0) = \sum (P_1) + \sum (P_2) \le V_f(a,c) + V_f(c,b) \]
	Taking supremum on the left side, we get
	\[ V_f(a,b) \le V_f(a,c) + V_f(c,b) \]
	Therefore,
	\[ V_f(a,b) = V_f(a,c) + V_f(c,b),\quad \forall c \in (a,b) \]
\end{proof}

\subsection{Total Variation on $[a,x]$ as a function of $x$}
\begin{commentary}
	By additive property, we have existence of $V_f(a,x)$ for every $x \in (a,b]$.
	Assigning $V(x) = V_f(a,x)$, we have a well-defined function on $(a,b]$.
\end{commentary}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be a function of bounded variation on $[a,b]$.
	Define $V : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ given by,
	\[ V(x) = \begin{cases} V_f(a,x) & x \in (a,b] \\ 0 & x = a \end{cases} \]
	Then,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $V$ is an increasing function on $[a,b]$.
		\item $V-f$ is an increasing function of $[a,b]$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $x = a$.
	Then $V(x) = 0$ and $V(y) = V_f(a,y) \ge 0 = V(x)$.\\
	Suppose $x \ne a$.
	Then, $a < x < y \le b$.
	By additive property of total variation, we have $V(y) = V_f(a,y) = V_f(a,x)+V_f(x,y) = V(x) + V_f(x,y)$.
	Since $V_f(x,y) \ge 0$, we have $V(x) \le V(y)$.
	Therefore, $V$ is an increasing function on $[a,b]$.\\

	Define $D : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $D(x)  = (V-f)(x) = V(x) - f(x)$.
	Suppose $a \le x < y \le b$.
	Then, $D(y)-D(x) = V(y)-f(y)-V(x)+f(x) = [V(y)-V(x)] - [f(y)-f(x)]$.
	We have, $V(y) = V_f(a,y) = V_f(a,x)+V_f(x,y)$.
	Thus, $V(y)-V(x) = V_f(x,y)$.
	Also we have, $f$ is of bounded variation on $[x,y]$.
	Consider the trivial partition $P = \{ x,y\}$ of $[x,y]$.
	Then, we have $f(y) - f(x) = \sum (P) \le V_f(x,y)$.
	Thus, $D(y)-D(x) = V_f(x,y) - [f(y)-f(x)] \ge 0$.
	Therefore, $D = V-f$ is an increasing function on $[a,b]$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Function of bounded variation expressed as the difference of increasing functions}
\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be a function on $[a,b]$.
	Function $f$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ if and only if $f$ can be expressed as difference of two increasing functions.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f$ be a function of bounded variation, then $f = V-D$ where total variation $V$ and $D = V-f$ are both increasing.\\

	Let $f$ be function on $[a,b]$.
	Let $f = V-D$ where $V,D$ are increasing functions. 
	Then $V,D$ are of bounded variation, since monotonic functions on $[a,b]$ are of bounded variation.
	Also, we have $V-D$ is of bounded variation, since for any two functions of bounded variation their difference is also of bounded variation.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Continuous functions of bounded variation}
\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be a function of bounded variation on $[a,b]$. %Why it has to be of bounded variation ? For the existence of $V$ ?
	Let $V$ be the total variation function of $f$ defined on $[a,b]$.
	$f$ is continuous at a point if and only if $V$ is continuous at that point.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f$ be a function of bounded variation on $[a,b]$.
	Let $V$ be the total variation of $f$.
	Let $x,y \in [a,b]$, such that $x<y$.
	We have $V$ is an increasing function on $[a,b]$.
	And $f$ is difference of two increasing functions on $[a,b]$.
	Thus, $f(x+),\ f(x-),\ V(x+),\ V(x-)$ exists for any $x \in (a,b)$.
	It remains to prove that $V,f$ are continuous at $x \in (a,b)$.\\

	\textbf{Part 1 : $V$ continuous $\implies$ $f$ continuous}\\
	Suppose $x \ne a$, then $a<x<y\le b$.
	Let $P$ be any partition on $[a,x]$.
	Then there exists a partition $P'$ on $[a,y]$ such that $P \subset P'$.
	Consider, $P' = P\cup\{y\}$.
	Then, $V(y) > V(x)$ and $V(y)-V(x) \ge |f(y)-f(x)|$.
	Thus,
	\[ 0 \le |f(y)-f(x)| \le V(y)-V(x) \]
	The inequality is true for any $y>x$.
	Therefore,
	\[ 0 \le |f(x+)-f(x)| \le V(x+)-V(x) \text{ as } y \to x+ \]
	Similarly, let $a<z<x$.
	Then,
	\[ 0 \le |f(x)-f(x-)| \le V(x)-V(x-) \text{ as } z \to x- \]
	Clearly, if $V$ is continuous at $x$ then $f$ is continuous $x$.\\

	\textbf{Part 2 : $f$ continuous $\implies$ $V$ continuous}\\
	Suppose $f$ is continuous at $c \in (a,b)$.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	We have,
	\[ V_f(c,b) = \sup_{P \in \mathscr{P}} \sum (P) \]
	Thus, there exists a partition $P_1 \in \mathscr{P}[c,b]$ such that $V_f(c,b) - \frac{\varepsilon}{2} < \sum (P_1)$.
	Since $f$ is continuous at $c$, there exists $x_1 \in (c,b)$ such that $|f(x_1)-f(c)| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$.
	Then,
	\[ V_f(c,b) - \frac{\varepsilon}{2} < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + V_f(x_1,b) \]
	We have,
	\begin{align*}
	V(x_1)-V(c) 
		& = V_f(a,x_1) - V_f(a,c) = V_f(c,x_1) \\
		& = V_f(c,b) - V_f(x_1,b) < \varepsilon
	\end{align*}
	Clearly, $V(c+h) \to V(c)$ as $h \to 0$.
	That is, $V(c+) = V(c),\ \forall c \in [a,b)$.
	Similarly we have,
	\[ V_f(a,c) = \sup_{P \in \mathscr{P}} \sum (P) \]
	And there exists $P_2 \in \mathscr{P}[a,c]$ such that
	\[ V_f(a,c) - \frac{\varepsilon}{2} < \sum (P_2) \]
	And there exists $x_2 \in (a,c)$ such that $|f(c)-f(x_2)| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$, since $f$ is continuous at $c$.
	Therefore,
	\[ V(c)-V(x_2) = V_f(a,c) - V_f(a,x_2) = V(x_2,c) < \varepsilon \]
	Thus, $V(c-) = V(c),\ \forall c \in (a,b]$.
	Therefore, $V$ is continuous at $c$.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$.
	Function $f$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ if and only if $f$ can be expressed as difference of two increasing continuous functions.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$.
	Then total variation $V$ is a continuous increasing function on $[a,b]$.
	Clearly, $D = V-f$ is also a continuous, increasing function on $[a,b]$.
	Therefore, $f = V - D$ where $V,D$ are continuous, increasing functions.\\

	Let $V,D$ be continuous, increasing functions on $[a,b]$.
	Then $f = V-D$ is also a continuous function on $[a,b]$.
	We have, $V,D$ are increasing functions, therefore both $V,D$ are of bounded variation and their difference $f$ is also of bounded variation.
\end{proof}

\begin{commentary}
	Suppose $f$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$.
	Let $id : [a,b] \to [a,b]$ where $id(x) = x$.
	Then $V+id$ is a strictly increasing function and $D = V+id-f$ is also strictly increasing.
	Thus, any function of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ can be characterised as difference of two strictly increasing continuous functions on $[a,b]$.
\end{commentary}
\subsection{Curves and Paths}
\begin{definition}[path]
	Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a continuous, vector-valued function.
	Then $f$ is a path in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
	And $f$ is a motion if $[a,b]$ is a time interval.
\end{definition}
\subsection{Rectifiable paths and Arc length}
\begin{definition}[rectifiable path]
	Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a path in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
	Let $P = \{ t_0,t_1,\dots,t_m \}$ be a partition of $[a,b]$.
	\[ \Lambda_f (P) = \sum_{k=1}^m \| f(t_k) - f(t_{k-1}) \| = \sum_{k=1}^m \| \Delta f_k \| \]
	If $\Lambda_f (P)$ is bounded for any partition $P \in \mathscr{P}[a,b]$, then path $f$ is \textbf{rectifiable}.
	If $\Lambda_f (P)$ is unbounded, then $f$ is \textbf{nonrectifiable}.\\
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[arc length]
	Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a rectifiable path.
	Then \textbf{arc length} of path $f$ is given by,
	\[ \Lambda_f(a,b) = \sup_{P \in \mathscr{P}} \Lambda_f (P) \]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	A path $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is rectifiable if and only if each component $f_k$ of $f$ is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$.
	Let $V_k(a,b)$ be the total variation of $f_k$ on $[a,b]$.
	Then,
	\[ V_k(a,b) \le \Lambda_f(a,b) \le V_1(a,b) + V_2(a,b) + \dots + V_n(a,b) \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $x_j \in \mathbb{R}^n$ for $j = 1,2,\dots,m$.
	Then,
	\[ |x_r| \le \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^n |x_j|^2} \le \sum_{j=1}^n |x_j| \text{ since } \sum_{j=1}^n x_j^2 \le \left(\sum_{j=1}^n x_j\right)^2 \]
	Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a path in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
	Then $f = (f_1,f_2,\dots,f_n)$ where $f_k$'s are components of the path $f$.
	Let $P = \{ t_0,t_1,\dots,t_m \}$ be a partition of $[a,b]$.
	Now $f_r(t_j)-f_r(t_{j-1}) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ for each subinterval of $[a,b]$ and each component of $f$.
	Thus for each subinterval $(t_j,t_{j-1})$ we have,
	\[ |f_r(t_j)-f_r(t_{j-1})| \le \| f(t_j)-f(t_{j-1}) \| \le \sum_{j=1}^n |f_k(t_j)-f_k(t_{j-1})| \] 
	Adding inequalities for every subinterval of the partition, we get
	\[ \sum_{k=1}^m |f_k(t_j)-f_k(t_{j-1})| \le \sum_{k=1}^m \| f(t_j)-f(t_{j-1}) \| \le \sum_{k=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n |f_k(t_j)-f_k(t_{j-1})| \] 
	Rearranging summation, we get
	\[ \sum (P) \le \Lambda_f (P) \le \sum_{j=1}^n \left( \sum (P)_{f_j} \right) \] 
	Suppose $f$ is a rectifiable path.
	Then $f$ has finite arc length $\Lambda_f (a,b)$.
	Let $f_k$ be a component function of $f$.
	Let $P$ be a partition of $[a,b]$.
	Then,
	\[ \sum (P) \le \Lambda_f(P) \le \Lambda_f (a,b) \]
	Thus, $\sum (P)$ is bounded for any partition $P$.
	Therefore, total variation $V_k(a,b)$ exists for each component function $f_k$.
	And $V_k(a,b) \le \Lambda_f(a,b)$.\\

	Suppose $f_k$'s are of bounded variation.
	Then \[ \Lambda_f(P) \le \sum_{j=1}^n \sum (P) \le \sum_{j=1}^n V_j(a,b) \] is bounded for any partition $P$.
	Thus, $f$ is rectifiable.
	And, arc length $\displaystyle \Lambda_f(a,b) \le \sum_{k=1}^n V_k (a,b)$.
	Combining the inequalities, we get
	\[ V_k(a,b) \le \Lambda_f(a,b) \le \sum_{j=1}^n V_j (a,b) \]
\end{proof}
\subsection{Additive and Continuity Properties of Arc length}
\begin{theorem}[additive]
	Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a rectifiable path.	
	Let $c \in (a,b)$.
	Then,
	\[ \Lambda_f(a,b) = \Lambda_f(a,c) + \Lambda_f(c,b) \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $P$ be a partition of $[a,b]$.
	Then $P' = P \cup \{c\}$ is a refinement of $P$ such that $P' = P_1 \cup P_2$ where $P_1,P_2$ are partition of $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$ respectively.
	We have,
	\[ \Lambda_f(P) \le \Lambda_f(P') = \Lambda_f(P_1) + \Lambda_f(P_2) \]
	This inequality if true for any partition of $[a,b]$.
	Thus,
	\[ \Lambda_f(a,b) \le \Lambda_f(a,c) + \Lambda_f(c,b) \]
	Let $P_1,P_2$ be partition of $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$ respectively.
	Then,
	\[ \Lambda_f(P_1) + \Lambda_f(P_2) \le \Lambda_f(P) \le \Lambda_f(a,b) \]
	This inequality if true for any paritions on $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$.
	Thus,
	\[ \Lambda_f(a,c) + \Lambda_f(c,b) \le \Lambda_f(a,b) \]
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[continuity]
	Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be  rectifiable path.
	Let function $s : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by
	\[ s(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & x = a \\ \Lambda_f(a,x) & x \in (a,b] \end{cases} \]
	Then,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item function $s$ is continuous and increasing on $[a,b]$.
		\item if there is no subinterval of $[a,b]$ in which $f$ is constant, then $s$ is strictly increasing.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $a \le x < y \le b$.
	Then, $s(y)-s(x) = \Lambda_f(x,y) = \Lambda(a,y) - \Lambda(a,x) \ge 0$.
	Therefore, $s$ in increasing.\\
	
	Suppose $f$ is not constant in any subinterval $[x,y]$ of $[a,b]$.
	Suppose $s$ is not strictly increasing.
	Then, there exists $x,y \in (a,b)$ such that $x < y$ and $s(y)-s(x) = 0$.
	Thus,
	\[ \Lambda_f(a,y) - \Lambda(a,x) = \Lambda_f(x,y) = 0 \]
	Thus, $V_k(x,y) = 0,\ \forall k$ which is a contradition since $f$ is not constant in $[x,y]$.
	Therefore, $s$ is strictly increasing.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Equivalence of path, Change of parameter}
\begin{definition}[change of parameter]
	Let $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a path.
	Let $g : [c,d] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be another path.
	Then $f,g$ are \textbf{equivalent} if there exists a continuous, real-valued function, $u : [c,d] \to [a,b]$ such that $g = f \circ u$.
	That is, $g(t) = f(u(t)),\ \forall t \in [c,d]$.
	In other words, $f,g$ are different parametric representations of a common graph.\\

	Function $u$ defines a change of parameter.
	If $u$ is strictly increasing, then $f,g$ are in the same direction.
	And $u$ is an orientation preserving change of parameter.
	If $u$ is strictly decreasing, then $f,g$ are in opposite directions.
	And $u$ is an orientation reversing change of parameter.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[change of parameter]
	Let $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be two paths.
	Let $f,g$ be both injective functions.
	Then $f$ and $g$ are equivalent if they have the same graph.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $g : [c,d] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be continuous, injective, vector-valued functions.
	Suppose $f,g$ are equivalent paths, then $f,g$ have the same graph.\\

	Suppose $f,g$ have the same graph.
	Since $f$ is injective and continuous on its domain $[a,b]$, function $f^{-1}$ exists and is continuous on its graph.
	\[ \text{Define } u:[c,d] \to [a,b],\ u(t) = f^{-1}(g(t)) \]
	Then $u$ is continuous and $g(t) = f(u(t))$.
	Suppose $u$ is not a strictly monotonic function. 
	Since $u$ is continuous, there exists $t_1,t_2 \in [c,d]$ such that $u(t_1) = u(t_2)$.
	Then $f(u(t_1)) = f(u(t_2)) \implies g(t_1) = g(t_2)$ which is a contradiction since $g$ is injective on $[c,d]$.

\section{The Riemann-Stieltjes Integral}
\begin{definition}[unti step]
	The unit step function $I : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by
	\[ I(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & x \le 0 \\ 1 & x > 0 \end{cases} \] 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Riemann Integral]
	Let $f$ be a bounded real function defined on $[a,b]$.
	Let $P = \{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ be a partition of $[a,b]$.
	Let $M_k = \sup \{ f(x) : x \in [x_{k-1},x_k] \}$ and $m_k = \inf \{ f(x) : x \in [x_{k-1},x_k]$.\\

	Then Riemann upper sum of function $f$ with respect to parition $P$,
	\[ U(P,f) = \sum_P M_k \Delta x_k = \sum_{k=1}^n M_k (x_k-x_{k-1}) \]
	And Riemann lower sum of $f$ with respect to $P$,
	\[ L(P,f) = \sum_{k=1}^n m_k (x_k-x_{k-1}) \]
	Now, Riemann upper integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$,
	\[ \upint_a^b f\ dx = inf \{ U(P,f) : P \in \mathscr{P}[a,b] \} \]
	And, Riemann lower integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$,
	\[ \lowint_a^b f\ dx = sup \{ L(P,f) : P \in \mathscr{P}[a,b] \} \]
	A function $f$ is Riemann integrable over $[a,b]$ if Riemann lower and upper integrals of $f$ over $[a,b]$ are the same.
	Then Riemann integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$,
	\[ \int_a^b f\ dx = \upint_a^b f\ dx = \lowint_a^b f\ dx \]
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Riemann-Stieltjes Integral]
	Let $f$ be a bounded function on $[a,b]$.
	Let $\alpha$ be an increasing function on $[a,b]$.
	Let $P = \{ x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ be a partition of $[a,b]$.
	Then, the Riemann-Stieltjes upper sum of $f$ with respect to partition $P$ and increasing function $\alpha$,
	\[ U(P,f,\alpha) = \sum_{k=1}^n M_k \Delta \alpha_k \]
	where $M_k = \sup \{ f(x) : x \in [x_{k-1},x_k] \}$ and $\Delta \alpha_k = \alpha(x_k) - \alpha(x_{k-1})$.
	Similarly, Riemann-Stieltjes lower sum,
	\[ L(P,f,\alpha) = \sum_{k=1}^n m_k \Delta \alpha_k \]
	where $m_k = \inf \{ f(x) : x \in [x_{k-1},x_k] \}$.
	And function $f$ is Riemann-Stieltjes integrable if Riemann Stieltjes upper and lower integrals are the same.
	\[ \int_a^b f\ d\alpha = \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha = \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha \]
	where $\displaystyle \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha = \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha(x) = \inf \left\{ U(P,f,\alpha) : P \in \mathscr{P}[a,b] \right\}$ and\\
	$\displaystyle \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha = \sup \left\{ L(P,f,\alpha) : P \in \mathscr{P}[a,b] \right\}$.\\

	We write $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$, which means that a bounded, real function $f$ is Riemann-Stieltjes integrable on $[a,b]$ with respect to the increasing function $\alpha$.
\end{definition}

\textbf{Note : } function $\alpha : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is monotonic (increasing), but not necessarily continuous.\\

\textbf{Remark : } With $\alpha = id$ identity function, Riemann-Stieltjes integral is Riemann integral itself.
	That is, Riemann integral is a special case of Riemann-Stieltjes integral.

\begin{theorem}
	Let $P^\ast$ be a refinement of a parition $P$ of $[a,b]$.
	Then, $L(P,f,\alpha) \le L(P^\ast,f,\alpha)$ and $U(P^\ast,f,\alpha) \le U(P,f,\alpha)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $P^\ast = P \cup \{ x \}$ where $x$ belongs to the $i$th subinterval $(x_{j-1},x_j)$.
	Define $w_1 = \min \{ f(x) : x \in (x_{j-1},x) \}$ and $w_2 = \min \{ f(x) : x \in (x,x_j) \}$.
	Clearly, $w_1,w_2 \ge \min \{ f(x) : x \in (x_{j-1},x_j) \} = m_i$.
	\begin{align*}
	L(P,f,\alpha) - L(P^\ast,f,\alpha) 
		& = m_i \Delta \alpha_j - w_1 (\alpha(x)-\alpha(x_{j-1})) - w_2 (\alpha(x_j) - \alpha(x)) \\
		& = (m_i - w_1)(\alpha(x)-\alpha(x_{j-1})) + (m_i - w_2)(\alpha(x_j)-\alpha(x))\\
		& \ge 0
	\end{align*}
	By mathematical induction the inequality is true for any refinement $P^\ast$ of $P$.
	Therefore, $L(P,f,\alpha) \ge L(P^\ast,f,\alpha)$.\\

	Similarly, define $W_1 = \max \{f(x) : x \in (x_{j-1},x) \}$ and $W_2 = \max \{ f(x) : x \in (x,x_j) \}$
	where $W_1,W_2 \le \max \{ f(x) : x \in (x_{j-1},x_j) \} = M_i$.
	\begin{align*}
	U(P,f,\alpha) - U(P^\ast,f,\alpha) 
		& = M_i \Delta \alpha_j - W_1 (\alpha(x)-\alpha(x_{j-1})) - W_2 (\alpha(x_j) - \alpha(x)) \\
		& = (M_i - W_1)(\alpha(x)-\alpha(x_{j-1})) + (M_i - W_2)(\alpha(x_j)-\alpha(x))\\
		& \le 0
	\end{align*}
	Again, the result is true for any refinement $P$ and we have
	\[ U(P,f,\alpha) \le U(P^\ast,f,\alpha) \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be a bounded, real function on $[a,b]$ and $\alpha$ increasing function on $[a,b]$.
	Then,
	\[ \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha \le \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $P_1,P_2$ be any two partition of $[a,b]$.
	Let $P^\ast = P_1 \cup P_2$ be a refinement of both partitions.
	Then, we have $L(P^\ast,f,\alpha) \le U(P^\ast,f,\alpha)$.
	And,
	\[ \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha \le L(P_1,f,\alpha) \text{ and } U(P_2,f,\alpha) \le \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha \]
	Therefore, \[ L(P_1,f,\alpha) \le L(P^\ast,f,\alpha) \le U(P^\ast,f,\alpha) \le U(P_2,f,\alpha) \]
	Clearly, the inequality holds independent of the choice of the partition.\\
	Taking supremum on right and infimum on left, we get
	\[ \sup_{P \in \mathscr{P}} L(P,f,\alpha) \le \inf_{ P \in \mathscr{P}} U(P,f,\alpha) \]
	Therefore,
	\[ \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha \le \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[criterion for integrability]
	Let $f$ be  a bounded, real function on $[a,b]$.
	Let $\alpha$ be an increasing function on $[a,b]$.
	Then, $f$ is Riemann-Stieltjes integrable on $[a,b]$ with repesct to $\alpha$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ such that $U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{commentary}
	In other words, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ if and only if 
	\[ \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists P \in \mathscr{P}[a,b] \text{ such that }U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon \]
\end{commentary}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Suppose there exists a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ such that $U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon$.
	We have,
	\[ L(P,f,\alpha) \le \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha \le \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha \le U(P,f,\alpha) \]
	\[ \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha - \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha \le U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon \]
	Clearly, $\lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha = \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha$.
	Therefore, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$.\\

	Suppose $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
	Then by the definition of infimum there exists a partition $P_1$ of $[a,b]$ such that 
	\[ U(P_1,f,\alpha) - \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \]
	Similarly, there exists a partition $P_2$ of $[a,b]$ such that
	\[ \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha - L(P_2,f,\alpha) < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \]
	Consider $P^\ast = P_1 \cup P_2$.
	Clearly, $P^\ast$ is a refinement for both $P_1$ and $P_2$.
	Thus, \[ U(P^\ast,f,\alpha) - \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \]
	And,
	\[ \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha - L(P^\ast,f,\alpha) < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \]
	Thus, \[ U(P^\ast,f,\alpha) - \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha + \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha - L(P^\ast,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon \]
	Given, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
	Therefore, $U(P^\ast,f,\alpha) - L(P^\ast,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Suppose $\varepsilon > 0$ and $U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon$ for some partition $P$ of $[a,b]$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The inequaility is true for any refinement of $P$.
		\item Let $s_i,t_i \in [x_{i-1},x_i]$ for each subinterval of the partition $P$.
			\[ \sum_{i=1}^n \left| f_(s_i)-f(t_i) \right|\ \Delta\alpha_i < \varepsilon \]
		\item If $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ and $t_i \in [x_{i-1},x_i]$ for each subinterval of the partition $P$, then
			\[ \left| \sum_{i=1}^n f(t_i) \Delta \alpha_i - \int_a^b f \ d\alpha \right| < \varepsilon \]
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
		Suppose $U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon$.
		Let $P^\ast$ be a refinement of $P$.
		We have $U(P,f,\alpha) \ge U(P^\ast,f,\alpha)$ and $L(P,f,\alpha) \le L(P^\ast,f,\alpha)$.
		Thus,
		\[ U(P^\ast,f,\alpha)-L(P^\ast,f,\alpha) \le U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon \]
	\item Let $s_i,t_i \in (x_{i-1},x_i)$.
		Clearly, for each subinterval $(x_{i-1},x_i)$, we have $m_i \le f(s_i) \le M_i$ and $m_i \le f(t_i) \le M_i$.
		Thus,
		\[ |f(t_i) - f(s_i)| \le  M_i - m_i \]
		\[ \sum_{i=1}^n |f(t_i) - f(s_i)| \Delta \alpha_i \le \sum_{i=1}^n (M_i - m_i) \Delta \alpha_i \le U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha) \le \varepsilon \]
	\item Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
		Let $P$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ such that $U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon$.
		We have,
		\[ L(P,f,\alpha) \le \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha \le \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha \le U(P,f,\alpha) \]
		Suppose $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ over $[a,b]$.
		Then, 
		\[ L(P,f,\alpha) \le \int_a^b f\ d\alpha \le U(P,f,\alpha) \] 

		Let $t_i \in (x_{i-1},x_i)$ for each subinterval of the partition $P$.
		Clearly, $m_i \le f(t_i) \le M_i$.
		Thus, we also have
		\[ L(P,f,\alpha) \le \sum_{i=1}^n f(t_i) \Delta \alpha_i \le U(P,f,\alpha) \]
		Therefore, 
		\[ \left| \sum_{i=1}^n f(t_i) \ \Delta \alpha_i - \int_a^b f\ d\alpha \right| \le U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon \]
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
	If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$.
	Since continuous functions defined on compact subsets metric spaces are uniformly continuous, we have $f$ is uniformly continuous.\\

	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Choose $\eta > 0$ such that $[\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)]\eta < \varepsilon$.
	Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x)-f(t)| < \eta$ whenever $|x-t| < \delta$.	
	Consider the partition $P$ such that each subinterval is of length less than $\delta$.
	For any $s_i,t_i \in (x_{i-1},x_i)$, we have
	\begin{align*}
	\sum_{i=1}^n [f(t_i) - f(s_i)] \ [\alpha(x_i)-\alpha(x_{i-1})] 
		& \le \sum_{i=1}^n \eta [\alpha(x_i)-\alpha(x_{i-1})] \\
		& \le \eta \sum_{i=1}^n [\alpha(x_i)-\alpha(x_{i-1})] \\
		&	\le \eta[\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)] \\
		& < \varepsilon 
	\end{align*}
	Clearly, the result is true for minimum and maximum values of $f$ in each subinterval of $P$.
	Therefore, we have
	\[ U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon \]
	Thus, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ over $[a,b]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	If $f$ is monotonic on $[a,b]$ and $\alpha$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f$ be increasing on $[a,b]$.
	Let $\alpha$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.
	Let $n$ be any integer.
	We can construct a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ such that each the variation of $\alpha$ in each subinterval is fixed.
	That is, $\Delta \alpha_i = \frac{\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)}{n}$.
	Since $f$ is increasing, in each subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$, we have $M_i = f(x_i)$ and $m_i = f(x_{i-1})$.
	Now we have,
	\begin{align*}
	U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) 
		& = \sum_{i=1}^n M_i \Delta \alpha_i - \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \Delta \alpha_i \\
		& = \sum_{i=1}^n (M_i-m_i) \Delta \alpha_i \\
		& = \frac{\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})) \\
		& = \frac{\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)}{n} (f(b)-f(a))
	\end{align*}
	Thus, given $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $n$ such that $ (\alpha(b)-\alpha(a))(f(b)-f(a)) < n\varepsilon $.
	And, we get a partition $P$ by fixing $\Delta \alpha_i = \frac{\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)}{n}$ such that $ U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon $.\\

	In other words, $U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha)$ depends on $n$ and can be reduced to a value less than $\varepsilon$ by increasing the value of $n$.
	Therefore, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ over $[a,b]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	If $f$ bounded on $[a,b]$, $f$ has only finitely many points of discontinuities on $[a,b]$ and $\alpha$ is continuous at every point at which $f$ is discontinuous.
	Then $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $f$ is bounded and has only finitely many discontinuities on $[a,b]$.
	Since $f$ is bounded, we have $-M < f(x) < M$ for some real number $M$.
	Also, suppose that $\alpha$ is continuous at those points where $f$ is discontinuous on $[a,b]$.\\

	Let $E$ be the set of all discontinuitites of $f$ on $[a,b]$.
	Clearly, $|E|$ is finite.\\

	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Since, $\alpha$ is continuous at each point $e_j$ of $E$, \textcolor{blue}{there exists open intervals $(u_j,v_j)$ such that $\alpha$ is continuous on those intervals, $e_j$ belongs to the interior of these intervals and the sum of variation of $\alpha$ in those intervals is less than $\varepsilon$.}\\

	Removing these open intervals from $[a,b]$, we get a compact subset $K$ in which $f$ is continuous.
	Since $K$ is compact and $f$ is continuous on $K$, we have $f$ is uniformly continuous on $K$.\\

	Given $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x)-f(t)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $|x-t|<\delta$.
	Define a partition $P$ such that $u_j,\ v_j \in P$, $P$ doesn't have any point in the interior of any $(u_j,v_j)$.
	And if $x_{i-1} \ne u_j$, then $x_i$ is so choosen that $x_i-x_{i-1} < \delta$, dividing $K$ into subintervals of length less than $\delta$.
	Now, we have
	\begin{align*}
	U(P,f,\alpha) & - L(P,f,\alpha)
		 = \sum_{i=1}^n (M_i-m_i) \Delta \alpha_i  \\
		& \le \varepsilon \sum_{x_{i-1} \ne u_j} \Delta\alpha_i + 2M\sum_{x_{i-1} = u_j} \Delta\alpha_i \\
		& = \varepsilon \sum_{x_{i-1} \ne u_j} \left(\alpha(x_i)-\alpha(x_{i-1}) \right) + 2M\varepsilon \\
		& \le \varepsilon (\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)) + 2M\varepsilon
	\end{align*}
	Clearly, $U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha)$ is a function of $\varepsilon$ which can reduced below any real number greater than zero by reducing the value of $\varepsilon$.
	Therefore, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ over $[a,b]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Suppose $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$, $m \le f \le M$ on $[a,b]$, $\phi$ is continuous on $[m,M]$ and $h(x) = \phi(f(x))$.
	Then $h \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f$ be a function on $[a,b]$ such that $m \le f(x) \le M$ and $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ over $[a,b]$.
	Let $\phi$ be  continuous function on $[m,M]$.
	Then $\phi$ is uniformly continuous on $[m,M]$, since $[m,M]$ is compact.
	Thus, given $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|\phi(x)-\phi(t)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $|x-t|<\delta$.
	Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\delta < \varepsilon$.
	Otherwise choose a value less than $\varepsilon$ as $\delta$.\\

	Since $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ over $[a,b]$, there exists a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ such that
	\[ U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \delta^2 \]
	Consider the $i$th subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ of the partition $P$.
	Let $M_i$, $m_i$ be the maximum and minimum values of the function $f$ in $i$th subinterval of $P$.
	Now, we divided the collection of subintervals into two sets depending on the value of $M_i-m_i$ in comparison with $\delta$.
	Define $A$ as the set of all subintervals of $P$ such that $M_i-m_i < \delta$.
	And $B$ as the set of all subintervals of $P$ such that $M_i - m_i \ge \delta$.
	We know that,
	\[ \delta \sum_B \Delta \alpha_i \le \sum_B (M_i-m_i) \Delta \alpha_i < U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha) < \delta^2 \]
	Thus, $\displaystyle \sum_B \Delta \alpha_i < \delta$.\\

	Define $M_i^\ast$, $m_i^\ast$ as the maximum and minimum of the function $\phi \circ f$ each subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ of the partition $P$.
	Now, we have
	\begin{align*}
	U(P,\phi \circ f,\alpha) - L(P,\phi \circ f, \alpha)
		& = \sum_{i=1}^n (M_i^\ast - m_i^\ast) \Delta \alpha_i \\
		& = \sum_A (M_i^\ast - m_i^\ast) \Delta \alpha_i + \sum_B (M_i^\ast - m_i^\ast) \Delta \alpha_i 
		\intertext{Since $\phi$ is uniformly continuous,}
		& \le \varepsilon \sum_A \Delta \alpha_i + \sum_B (M_i^\ast-m_i^\ast)\Delta \alpha_i 
	\intertext{Since, continuous functions defined on compact subset attains extrema. We have, $K = \sup \{ |\phi(x)| : x \in [m,M] \}$. And $M_i^\ast - m_i^\ast < 2K$.}
		& \le \varepsilon (\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)) + 2K \sum_B \Delta \alpha_i \\
		& \le \varepsilon (\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)) + 2K\delta \\
		& \le \varepsilon (\alpha(b) - \alpha(a)) + 2K\varepsilon
	\end{align*}
	Since $U(P,\phi \circ f,\alpha)-L(P,\phi \circ f, \alpha)$ is function of $\varepsilon$, it can be reduced to any sufficiently small real number of our choice.
	Therefore, $\phi \circ f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ over $[a,b]$.

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Let $f_1,f_2 \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ over $[a,b]$. \\
	Let $P_1$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ such that $U(P_1,f_1,\alpha) - L(P_1,f_1,\alpha) < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$.\\
	Let $P_2$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ such that $U(P_2,f_2,\alpha) - L(P_2,f_2,\alpha) < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$.\\
	Let $P = P_1 \cup P_2$ be the refinedment of both the partitions.
	Then the above inequalities are true of the partition $P$ as well.\\

	We have,
	\begin{align*}
	L(P,f_1,\alpha) + L(P,f_2,\alpha) 
		& \le L(P,f_1+f_2,\alpha) \\
		& \le U(P,f_1+f_2,\alpha) \\
		& \le U(P,f_1,\alpha) + U(P,f_2,\alpha) 
	\end{align*}
	Thus,
	\begin{align*}
	U(P,f_1+f_2,\alpha) & - L(P,f_1+f_2,\alpha)\\
		& \le U(P,f_1,\alpha) - L(P,f_1,\alpha) + U(P,f_2,\alpha) - L(P,f_2,\alpha) \\
		& \le \varepsilon
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, $f_1+f_2 \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ over $[a,b]$.\\

	\hrule \vspace{1em}
	\item
	Let $c$ be any real number greater than zero.
	We have,
	\[ M_i' = \max \{ cf(x) : x \in [x_{i-1},x_i] \} = c \max \{ f(x) : x \in [x_{i-1},x_i] \} = cM_i \]
	Similarly, $m_i' = cm_i$.
	Thus,
	\[ \sum_{i=1}^n M_i'\Delta\alpha_i = c\sum_{i=1}^n M_i\Delta \alpha_i \text{ and } \sum_{i=1}^n m_i' \Delta\alpha_i = c\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \Delta\alpha_i \] 
	Therefore, given $\varepsilon > 0$ we have,
	\begin{align*}
		L(P,cf,\alpha) &= cL(P,f,\alpha) \\
		U(P,cf,\alpha) &= cU(P,f,\alpha)
	\end{align*}
	Since, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$, there exists partition $P$ such that $U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon$. Thus,
	\[ U(P,cf,\alpha)-L(P,cf,\alpha) = cU(P,f,\alpha)-cL(P,f,\alpha) < c\varepsilon \]
	Therefore, $cf \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ over $[a,b]$.
	\begin{align*}
	\int_a^b cf\ d\alpha 
		& \le U(P,cf,\alpha) \\
		& \le cU(P,f,\alpha) \\
		& \le c \int_a^b f\ d\alpha + c\varepsilon\\
		& \le c\int_a^b f\ d\alpha
	\intertext{Similarly, considering $-f$ and $-cf$ we get}
	\int_a^b cf\ d\alpha 
		& \ge c\int_a^b f\ d\alpha
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, without loss of generality for any real number $c$, 
		\[ \int_a^b cf\ d\alpha = c\int_a^b f\ d\alpha \]

	\hrule \vspace{1em}
	\item 
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Suppose $f_1,f_2 \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ and $f_1 \le f_2$.
	Let $P_1,P_2$ be the partitions such that $U(P_1,f_1,\alpha) - L(P_1,f_1,\alpha) < \varepsilon$ and $U(P_2,f_2,\alpha) - L(P_2,f_2,\alpha) < \varepsilon$.
	Consider the common refinement $P = P_1 \cup P_2$.
	Then, for each subinterval of the partition $P$, we have
	\[ \min_{x \in [x_{i-1},x_i]} f_1(x) \le \min_{x \in [x_{i-1},x_i]} f_2(x) \text{ and } \max_{x \in [x_{i-1},x_i]} f_1(x) \le \max_{x \in [x_{i-1},x_i]} f_2(x) \]
	Thus, $L(P,f_1,\alpha) \le L(P,f_2,\alpha)$ and $U(P,f_1,\alpha) \le U(P,f_2,\alpha)$.
	\begin{align*}
	\int_a^b f_1\ d\alpha 
		& \le U(P,f_1,\alpha) \\
		& \le U(P,f_2,\alpha) \\
		& \le \int_a^b f_2\ d\alpha + \varepsilon
	\end{align*}
	Therefore,
	\[ \int_a^b f_1\ d\alpha \le \int_a^b f_2\ d\alpha \]

	\hrule \vspace{1em}
	\item 
	Let $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Then, there exists a parition $P$ of $[a,b]$ such that $U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon$.
	Let $c \in (a,b)$.
	Then $P^\ast = P \cup \{c\} = P_1 \cup P_2$ is refinement of $P$ such that $P_1,P_2$ are partition of $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$ respectively.
	Clearly, $U(P_1,f,\alpha) - L(P_1,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon$ and $U(P_2,f,\alpha) - L(P_2,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon$.
	Therefore, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on both $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$.\\

	For any two partitions $P_1,P_2$ of $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$, there exists partition $P^\ast = P_1 \cup P_2$ of $[a,b]$.
	Thus,
	\begin{align*}
	\int_a^b f\ d\alpha 
		& \le U(P^\ast,f,\alpha) \\
		& \le U(P_1,f,\alpha) + U(P_2,f,\alpha) \\
		& \le \int_a^c f\ d\alpha + \int_c^b f\ d\alpha + 2\varepsilon
	\end{align*}
	Since $\varepsilon$ is arbitrary, we have
	\[ \int_a^b f\ d\alpha \le \int_a^c f\ d\alpha + \int_c^b f\ d\alpha \]
	And considering $-f$ instead of $f$, we get
	\[ \int_a^b -f\ d\alpha \le \int_a^c -f\ d\alpha + \int_c^b -f\ d\alpha \]
	Thus,
	\[ \int_a^b f\ d\alpha \ge \int_a^c f\ d\alpha + \int_c^b f\ d\alpha \]
	Therefore,
	\[ \int_a^b f\ d\alpha = \int_a^c f\ d\alpha + \int_c^b f\ d\alpha \]

	Let function $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ and $|f| \le M$.

	\[ L(P,f,\alpha) \le \int_a^b f\ d\alpha \le U(P,f,\alpha)\]
	And,
	\[ L(P,f,\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \Delta \alpha_i \ge -M\Delta \alpha_i = -M \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta \alpha_i = -M[\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)] \]
	Similarly,
	\[ U(P,f,\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n M_i \Delta \alpha_i \le M\Delta \alpha_i = M \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta \alpha_i = M[\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)] \]
	Therefore,
	\[ \left| \int_a^b f\ d\alpha \right| \le M[\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)] \]
		
	\hrule \vspace{1em}

	Let $\alpha_1,\alpha_2$ be monotonic functions on $[a,b]$.
	Then $|\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 | \le |\alpha_1| + |\alpha_2|$.
	Let $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha_1)$ on $[a,b]$ and $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha_2)$ on $[a,b]$.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Then there exists partitions $P_1,P_2$ of $[a,b]$ such that
	\[ U(P_1,f,\alpha_1) - L(P_1,f,\alpha_1) < \varepsilon \]
	\[ U(P_2,f,\alpha_2) - L(P_2,f,\alpha_2) < \varepsilon \]
	Consider the common refinement $P = P_1 \cup P_2$.
	Then, the inequalities are true for $P$ as well.
	And for each subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ of $P$, we have $\Delta(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)_i \le \Delta (\alpha_1)_i + \Delta (\alpha_2)_i$.
	Thus,
	\begin{align*}
	U(P,f,\alpha_1+\alpha_2) - L(P,f,\alpha_1+\alpha_2)
		& = \sum_{i=1}^n (M_i-m_i) \Delta (\alpha_1+\alpha_2)_i \\

		& \le 2\varepsilon
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)$ on $[a,b]$.
	\begin{align*}
	\int_a^b f\ d(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)

		& \le \int_a^b f\ d\alpha_1 + \int_a^b f\ d\alpha_2 + 2\varepsilon

	Thus,
	\[ \int_a^b f\ d(\alpha_1+\alpha_2) \le \int_a^b f\ d\alpha_1 + \int_a^b f\ d\alpha_2 \]
	Considering $-f$ instead of $f$,we get
	\[ \int_a^b f\ d(\alpha_1+\alpha_2) \ge \int_a^b f\ d\alpha_1 + \int_a^b f\ d\alpha_2 \]
	Therefore,

	Thus, $\phi \circ f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.
	Therefore, $\phi \circ f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.

	Let $f$ be bounded on $[a,b]$ and continuous at $s \in (a,b)$.
	Let $\alpha = I(t-s)$.
	Then,
		\[ \int_a^b f d\alpha = f(s) \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $P = \{ a,s,x_2,b \}$ be a partition of $[a,b]$.
	Since $f$ is bounded, 
		\[ U(P,f,\alpha) = M_1 \Delta\alpha_1 + M_2 \Delta \alpha_2+ M_3 \Delta\alpha_3 = M_2 \]
	since $\Delta\alpha_1 = 0$, we have $\Delta\alpha_2 = \alpha(x_2) - \alpha(s) = I(x_2-s) - I(0) = 1-0$ and $\Delta \alpha_3 = 0$.
	Similarly, $L(P,f,\alpha) = m_1\Delta\alpha_1 + m_2\Delta\alpha_2 + m_3\Delta\alpha_3 = m_2$.
	We have,
		\[ m_2 = L(P,f,\alpha) \le \lowint_a^b f d\alpha \le \upint_a^b f d\alpha \le U(P,f,\alpha) = M_2 \]
	We know that, $M_2$ is the maximum value of $f$ in the subinteval $[s,x_2]$.
	The lower sum and upper sum remains the same as we reduce the length of the second subinterval.
	We also know that, $f$ is continuous at $s$.
	As $x_2 \to s$, the maximum value of $f$ tends to the value of $f$ at $s$, say $f(s)$.
	Similarly,  $m_2 \to f(s)$ as $x_2 \to s$.
	Thus,
		\[ f(s) \le \lowint_a^b f d\alpha \le \upint_a^b f d\alpha \le f(s) \]
	Therefore, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ and

	By comparison test, $\alpha$ is convergent in $[a,b]$.
	We have,
	\[ \int_a^b f(t)\ d(c_1 I(t-s_1)) = c_1 \int_a^b f(t)\ d(I(t-s_1)) =  c_1 f(s_1) \]
	Let $\alpha = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2$ where $\displaystyle \alpha_1 = \sum_{n=1}^N c_n I(t-s_n)$ and $\displaystyle\alpha_2 = \sum_{n=N+1}^\infty c_n I(t-s_n)$.
	And from mathematical induction, we have
	\begin{align*}
	\int_a^b f(t) d(\alpha_1) 
		& = \int_a^b f(t)\ d\left( \sum_{n=1}^N c_n I(t-s_n) \right)\\
		& = \sum_{n=1}^N \int_a^b f(t)\ d(c_nI(t-s_n)) \\
		& = \sum_{n=1}^N c_n \int_a^b f dI(t-s_n) \\
		& = \sum_{n=1}^N c_n f(s_n) 
	\end{align*}
	We have,
	\[ \left| \int_a^b f(t) d\alpha_2 \right| \le M (\alpha_2(b) - \alpha_2(a)) = M \sum_{n=N+1}^\infty < M\varepsilon \]
	where $M = \sup |f(x)|$.
	Thus,
	\begin{align*}
	\left| \int_a^b fd\alpha_2 \right| 
		& = \left| \int_a^b f d(\alpha_1+\alpha_2) - \int_a^b fd\alpha_1 \right| \\
		& = \left| \int_a^b fd\alpha - \sum_{n=1}^N c_n f(s_n) \right| \\
		& < M\varepsilon 
	\end{align*}
	The inequality is true as $N \to \infty$. 
	In other words, the sequence of partial sums converges to the value of integral of $f$.
	Therefore,
	\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n f(s_n) = \int_a^b f d\alpha \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $\alpha$ be increasing function on $[a,b]$ and $\alpha' \in \mathscr{R}$.
	Let $f$ be bounded real-valued function on $[a,b]$.
	Then $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ if and only if $f\alpha' \in \mathscr{R}$.
	And
	\[ \int_a^b f d\alpha = \int_a^b f(x)\alpha'(x) dx \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Since $\alpha' \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ such that $U(P,\alpha')-L(P,\alpha') < \varepsilon$.
	We have, $\alpha$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, as it is differentiable on $[a,b]$.
	Then by intermediate value theorem, we have
	\[ \Delta \alpha_i = \alpha(x_i) - \alpha(x_{i-1}) = \alpha'(t_i) (x_i-x_{i-1}) \]
	where $t_i \in [x_{i-1},x_i]$.
	Let $s_i \in [x_{i-1},x_i]$.
	Then,
	\[ \sum_{i=1}^n |\alpha'(s_i) - \alpha'(t_i)|\Delta x_i \le U(P,\alpha') - L(P,\alpha') < \varepsilon \]
	Let $M = \sup |f|$.
	\textcolor{blue}{Let $u_i \in [x_{i-1},x_i]$.}
	\footnote{In my opinion, using $u_i$ instead of $s_i$ in the first sum makes it simpler.}
	Consider,
	\begin{align*}
	\left| \sum_{i=1}^n f(u_i) \Delta \alpha_i - \sum_{i=1}^n f(s_i) \alpha'(s_i) \Delta x_i \right| 
		& \le M \left| \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta \alpha_i - \alpha'(s_i) \Delta x_i \right| \\
		& \le M \left| \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha'(t_i) \Delta x_i - \alpha'(s_i) \Delta x_i \right| \\
		& \le M  \sum_{i=1}^n |\alpha'(t_i) - \alpha'(s_i)| \Delta x_i \\
		& < M \varepsilon 
	\end{align*}
	Clearly, the inequality is true independent of the choice of $u_i,s_i \in [x_{i-1},x_i]$.
	Thus, selecting $u_i$ such that $f(u_i) = M_i$, we get
	\[ \left| U(P,f,\alpha) - \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha'(s_i)\Delta x_i \right| < M\varepsilon \]
	Therefore,
	\[ \sum_{i=1}^n f(s_i) \alpha'(s_i) \Delta x_i < U(P,f,\alpha) + M\varepsilon \]
	Selecting $s_i$ such that $f\alpha'$ attains maximum at $s_i$, we get
	\[ U(P,f\alpha') < U(P,f,\alpha) + M\varepsilon \]
	Now, first we select $s_i$ such that $f\alpha(s_i)$ is maximum in $i$th subinterval of $P$.
	Then,
	\[ \left| \sum_{i=1}^n f(u_i) \Delta \alpha_i - U(P,f\alpha') \right| < M\varepsilon \]
	Therefore,
	\[ U(P,f\alpha') < \sum_{i=1}^n f(u_i) \Delta \alpha_i + M\varepsilon \]
	And, now selecting $u_i$ such that $f(u_i) = M_i$.
	\[ U(P,f\alpha') < U(P,f,\alpha) + M\varepsilon \]
	Therefore, we have $U(P,f\alpha') = U(P,f,\alpha)$.
	Clearly, it is true for any refinement of $P$.
	Therefore,
	\[ \upint_a^b f\alpha' dx = \upint_a^b f d\alpha \]
	Similary, by selecting $u_i$ and $s_i$ such that $f(u_i)$, $f\alpha'(s_i)$ is minimum in each subinterval of $P$, we get
	\[ \lowint_a^b f\alpha' dx = \lowint_a^b f d\alpha \]
	Cleary, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha) \iff f\alpha' \in \mathscr{R}$. And,
	\[ \int_a^b f\alpha' dx = \int_a^b f d\alpha \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[change of variable]
	Let $\varphi : [A,B] \to [a,b]$ be a strictly increasing, continuous function onto $[a,b]$.
	Let $\alpha : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be an increasing function and $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
	Define $\beta = \alpha \circ \varphi$ and $g = f \circ \varphi$.
	Then $g \in \mathscr{R}(\beta)$ on $[A,B]$ and 
	\[ \int_A^B g d\beta = \int_a^b f d\alpha \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $P = \{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ be any partition of $[a,b]$.
	Then there exists a partition $Q = \{ y_0,y_1,\dots,y_n\}$ of $[A,B]$ such that $x_j = \varphi(y_j)$ since $\varphi$ is a continuous, bijection.
	\dag\footnote{Strictly increasing functions are always injective.}
	Similarly, for any partition $Q = \{ y_0,y_1,\dots,y_n\}$ of $[A,B]$, there exists a partition $P = \{ x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ of $[a,b]$ where $x_j= \varphi(y_j)$.
	Clearly, minimum/maximum of $g$ in $i$th subinterval of $Q$ is same as the minimum/maximum of $f$ in $i$th subinterval of $P$.
	And 
	\[ \Delta \beta_i = \beta(y_i) - \beta(y_{i-1}) = \alpha(\varphi(y_i)) - \alpha(\varphi(y_{i-1})) = \alpha(x_i) - \alpha(x_{i-1}) = \Delta \alpha_i \]
	\begin{align*}
	\min \{ g(y) : y \in [y_{i-1},y_i] \}
		& = \min \{ f(\varphi(y)) : y \in [y_{i-1},y_i] \} \\
		& = \min \{ f(x) : x \in [x_{i-1},x_i] \} \\
	\implies L(Q,g,\beta) 
		& = L(P,f,\alpha) \\
	\max \{ g(y) : y \in [y_{i-1},y_i] \}
		& = \max \{ f(\varphi(y)) : y \in [y_{i-1},y_i] \} \\
		& = \max \{ f(x) : x \in [x_{i-1},x_i] \} \\
		\implies U(Q,g,\beta) & = U(P,f,\alpha) \\
	\end{align*}
	Since $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$, there exists a partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ such that $U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \varepsilon$.
	Therefore, there exists a partition $Q$ of $[A,B]$ such that $U(Q,g,\beta) - L(Q,g,\beta) < \varepsilon$.
	Thus, $g \in \mathscr{R}(\beta)$.
	And
	\[ \int_A^B g d\beta = \int_a^b f d\alpha \]
\end{proof}

\subsection{Integration and Differentiation}
\begin{theorem}
	Let $f \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$.
	Let $a \le x \le b$.
	Define
	\[ F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)dt \]
	Then $F$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.
	Furthermore, if $f$ is continuous at $x_0$, then $F$ is differentiable at $x_0$.
	And $F'(x_0) = f(x_0)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $a\le x < y \le b$.
	Let $M = \sup |f|$.
	We have,
	\begin{align*}
	|F(y)-F(x)| 
		& = \left| \int_a^y f(t) dt - \int_a^x f(t) dt \right| \\
		& = \left| \int_a^x f(t) dt + \int_x^y f(t) dt - \int_a^x f(t) dt \right| \\
		& = \left| \int_x^y f(t) dt \right| \\
		& \le M(y-x)
	\end{align*}
	Thus, given $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|F(y)-F(x)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $|y-x| < \delta \le \frac{\varepsilon}{M}$.
	Therefore, $F$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.\\

	Let $f$ be continuous at $x_0 \in [a,b]$.
	Given $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(t)-f(x_0)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $|t-x_0| < \delta$ and $t \in [a,b]$.\\

	Let $x-\delta < s \le x_0 \le t < x+\delta$.
	Clearly, $|f(u)-f(x_0)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $u \in [s,t]$.
	Consider,
	\begin{align*}
	\left| \frac{F(t) - F(s)}{t-s} - f(x_0) \right| 
		& = \left| \frac{1}{t-s} \left( \int_a^t f(u) du - \int_a^s f(u) du \right) - \frac{1}{t-s} f(x_0)(t-s) \right| \\
		& = \left| \frac{1}{t-s} \int_s^t f(u) du  - \frac{1}{t-s} \int_s^t f(x_0)du \right| \\
		& = \left| \frac{1}{t-s} \left( \int_s^t (f(u)-f(x_0)) du \right) \right| \\
		& < \frac{\varepsilon}{t-s} \int_s^t du \quad \text{ since } |f(u)-f(x_0)| < \varepsilon  \\
		& < \varepsilon
	\end{align*}
	Clearly, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, $\delta \to 0$.
	Then, $s,t \to x_0$.
	Therefore, $F$ differentiable at $x_0$ and
	\[ F'(x_0) = \lim_{s,t \to x_0} \frac{F(t)-F(s)}{t-s} =  f(x_0) \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[fundamental theorem of calculus]
	Let $f \in\mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$.
	Let $F$ be a differentiable function on $[a,b]$ such that $F'=f$.
	Then,
	\[ \int_a^b f(x)dx = F(b)-F(a) \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Let $f \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$.
	Then, there exists a partition $P = \{ x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ of $[a,b]$ such that $U(P,f)-L(P,f) < \varepsilon$.\\

	Let $F$ be differentiable function such that $F'=f$.
	Then, $F$ is continuous.
	By intermediate value theorem, there exists $t_i \in [x_{i-1},x_i]$ such that 
	\[ F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1}) = F'(t_i) (x_i-x_{i-1}) = f(t_i)\Delta x_i \]
	Clearly,
	\[ F(b) - F(a) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1}) \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n f(t_i) \Delta x_i \]
	Since $t_i \in [x_{i-1},x_i]$, we have $m_i \le f(t_i) \le M_i$.
	Thus,
	\[ \left| \int_a^b f(x) dx - \left(F(b)-F(a)\right) \right| = \left| \int_a^b f(x) dx - \sum_{i=1}^n f(t_i) \Delta x_i \right| < \varepsilon \]
	Therefore, 
	\[ \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a) \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[integration by parts]
	Let $F,G$ be differentiable $[a,b]$.
	Let $F' = f \in \mathscr{R}$ and $G' = g \in \mathscr{R}$.
	Then,
	\[ \int_a^b F(x)g(x) dx = F(b)G(b) - F(a)G(a) - \int_a^b f(x)G(x) dx \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $F,G$ be differentiable functions on $[a,b]$ and $F'=f \in \mathscr{R}$ and $G'=g \in \mathscr{R}$.
	Let $H = FG$. 
	Then, $H' = FG' + F'G = Fg + fG$.
	\[ \int_a^b H'(x) dx = \int_a^b F(x)g(x) dx + \int_a^b f(x)G(x) dx \]
	By fundamental theorem of calculus, we also have
	\[ \int_a^b H'(x) = H(b) - H(a) = FG(b) - FG(a) = F(b)G(b) - F(a)G(a) \]
	Rearranging the terms, we get
	\[ \int_a^b F(x)g(x) dx = F(b)G(b) - F(a)G(a) - \int_a^b f(x)G(x) dx \]
\end{proof}

\subsection{Integration of Vector-valued Functions}

	Let $\alpha$ be a monotonic function on $[a,b]$.
	Let $f_1,f_2,\dots,f_k$ be the component functions of $\bar{f}$.
	That is, $\bar{f}(x) = \left( f_1(x),f_2(x),\dots,f_k(x) \right)$.

	By definition of integrability of vector-valued functions, the component functions $f_j,g_j \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ for $1 \le j \le k$.\\

	We also know that, if $f_j, g_j \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$, then $f_j + g_j \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
	Thus, $f_1+g_1, f_2+g_2,\dots, f_k + g_k \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ for $1 \le j \le k$.

	Let $\bar{F} : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^k$.
	If $\bar{f} \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$ and $\bar{F}' = \bar{f}$, then
		\[ \int_a^b \bar{f}(t) dt = \bar{F}(b) - \bar{F}(a) \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By fundamental theorem of calculus, we have
	\[ \int_a^b f_j(t) dt = F_j(b) - F_j(a) \]
 	for $1 \le j \le k$.
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
	\int_a^b \bar{f}(t) dt
		& = \left( \int_a^b f_1(t) dt, \int_a^b f_2(t) dt, \dots, \int_a^b f_k(t) dt \right) \\
		& = \left( F_1(b)-F_1(a), F_2(b) - F_2(a), \dots, F_k(b) - F_k(a) \right) \\
		& = \left( F_1(b),F_2(b),\dots,F_k(b)\right) - \left(F_1(a), F_2(a),\dots,F_k(a)\right) \\
		& = \bar{F}(b) - \bar{F}(a)
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $\bar{f} : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^k$.
	If $\bar{f} \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$, then $|\bar{f}| \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
	And
	\[ \left| \int_a^b \bar{f} d\alpha \right| \le \int_a^b |\bar{f}| d\alpha \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\bar{f} : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^k$.
	Then, we have $\bar{f} = (f_1,f_2,\dots,f_k)$.\\
	Suppose $\bar{f} \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
	Then, $f_j \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ for $1 \le j \le k$.
	We have, $|\bar{f}| = \left( f_1^2+f_2^2+\dots+f_k^2 \right)^\frac{1}{2}$.
	We know that if $f_j \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$, then $f_j^2 \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$.
	Again, $\sum f_j^2 \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$.\\

	Consider $g : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $g(x) = \sum_{j=1}^k f_j^2(x)$.
	\textcolor{blue}{We have $g \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.}
	Thus $g$ is bounded and there exists $m,M$ such that $m \le g \le M$.
	Clearly, $g \ge 0$.\\

	Consider, the function $\phi : [m,M] \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $\phi(x) = \sqrt{x}$.
	Clearly, $\phi$ is well-defined on $[m,M]$ since $0 \le m$.
	And, $\phi$ is continuous on $[m,M]$.
	Thus, $|\bar{f}| = \phi \circ g = \sqrt{\sum f_j^2} \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.\\

	\hrule \vspace{1em}
	
	Let $\displaystyle \bar{y} = \int_a^b \bar{f} d\alpha$.
	Then, $\bar{y} = (y_1,y_2,\dots,y_k)$ and $\displaystyle y_j = \int_a^b f_j d\alpha$.
	\begin{align*}
	|\bar{y}|^2 
		& = y_1^2 + y_2^2 + \dots + y_k^2\\
		& = y_1 \int_a^b f_1 d\alpha + y_2 \int_a^b f_2 d\alpha + \dots + y_k \int_a^b f_k d\alpha \\
		& = \int_a^b (y_1f_1 + y_2f_2 + \dots + y_kf_k) d\alpha
	\end{align*}
	By Schwarz inequality,
		\[ \sum_{j=1}^n y_j f_j \le \left( \sum_{j=1}^n y_j^2 \right)^\frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{j=1}^n f_j^2 \right)^\frac{1}{2} = |\bar{y}| \ |\bar{f}| \]
	Thus,
		\[ {\color{blue}|\bar{y}|^2} = \int_a^b \left( \sum_{j=1}^k y_jf_j \right) d\alpha \le \int_a^b |\bar{y}|\ |\bar{f}| d\alpha = |\bar{y}| \int_a^b |\bar{f}| d\alpha \]
	Therefore,
		\[ \left| \int_a^b \bar{f} d\alpha \right| = |\bar{y}| \le \int_a^b |\bar{f}| d\alpha \]

{\Large Module 3}
\section{Sequence and Series of functions}
\begin{definition}
	Let sequence $\sequence{f_n}$ be a sequence of functions defined on $E$.
	Suppose sequence $\sequence{f_n(x)}$ converges forevery $x \in E$.
	Then, sequence $\sequence{f_n}$ converges.
	And \textbf{limit function} $f : E \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by
	\[ f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) \]
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
	Let $f_n : E \to \mathbb{R},\ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$.
	Suppose $\sum f_n(x)$ converges for every $x \in E$.
	Then, series $\sum f_n$ converges.
	And \textbf{sum} $f : E \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by
	\[ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x) \]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Counter Examples - Illustrating Main problem}
\textbf{Main Problem} : Can we obtain the sufficient conditions for preserving desirable properties under convergence ?
\subsubsection*{Interchanging limits}
\[ \text{Generally,}\quad \lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{m \to \infty} S_{n,m} \ne \lim_{m \to \infty} \lim_{n \to \infty} S_{n,m} \]
\begin{proof}
Consider, $S_{n,m} = \frac{m}{m+n}$.
\begin{align*}
	\lim_{m \to \infty} \lim_{n \to \infty} S_{n,m} & = \lim_{m \to \infty } 0 = 0 \\
	\lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{m \to \infty} S_{n,m} & = \lim_{n \to \infty } 1 = 1 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Continuity}
\[ \sequence{f_n} \to f,\ f_n \text{ continuous } \nimplies f \text{ continuous} \]
\begin{proof}
Consider $f_n(x) = \frac{x^2}{(1+x^2)^n}$.
	Clearly, $f_n : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous for every natural number $n$.\\

\textbf{Case 1 : $x = 0$}\\
Suppose $x = 0$.
Then, $f_n(0) = 0$ and therefore $\displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(0) = 0$. \\

\textbf{Case 2 : $x \ne 0$}\\
	Suppose $x \ne 0$.
	Then $\frac{1}{1+x^2} < 1,\ \forall x \in \mathbb{R},\ (x \ne 0)$.\\
Therefore,
\[ f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = x^2 \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\frac{1}{1+x^2}\right)^n = x^2 \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{1+x^2}} = x^2 \frac{1+x^2}{x^2} = 1+x^2 \]
	Clearly from cases $1$ and $2$,\\
	\[ f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R},\ f(x)= \begin{cases} 0 & x = 0 \\ 1+x^2 & x \ne 0 \end{cases} \quad \text{ is not continuous at } 0 \]
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{integrability} 
\[ \sequence{f_n} \to f, f_n \in \mathscr{R} \nimplies f \in \mathscr{R} \]
\begin{proof}
Consider, $\displaystyle f_m(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} (\cos m!\pi x)^{2n}$.\\

Suppose $m!x$ is not an integer.
Then $\displaystyle f_m(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} (y^2)^n = 0$ since $-1<y = \cos m! \pi x <1$.
Suppose $m!x$ is an integer.
Then $\cos m! \pi x = \pm 1$ and $\displaystyle f_m(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} ((\pm 1)^2)^n = 1$.\\

We know that, if $x \in \mathbb{Q}$, then $x = \pm \frac{p}{q}$ where $p,q \in \mathbb{N}$.
Clearly, for any $m > q$, $m! x$ is an integer and $f_m(x) =1 $ for any $m > q$.
Therefore, $\displaystyle \lim_{m \to \infty} f_m(x) = 1$ if $x \in \mathbb{Q}$.
And $\displaystyle \lim_{m \to \infty} f_m(x) = 0$ if $x \notin \mathbb{Q}$ since $m! x$ is not an integer for any $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and $f_m(x) = 0,\ \forall m \in \mathbb{N}$.\\

Now, $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $\displaystyle f(x) = \lim_{m \to \infty} f_m(x)$ is given by,
	\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & x \in \mathbb{Q} \\ 0 & x \notin \mathbb{Q} \end{cases} \text{ which is \textbf{everywhere discontinuous.}} \]
	Clearly, $f$ is not Riemann integrable since $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}-\mathbb{Q}$ are dense in any subinterval.
	Thus, $m_i = 0$ and $M_i = 1$ in any subinterval of any partition $P$.
	\[ \lowint_0^1 f(x)\ dx = 0 \ne 1 = \upint_0^1 f(x)\ dx \]

\begin{important}
Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$.
Consider closed interval $E = [-1,1]$.
Then there exists finitely many rational numbers $x$ on $E$ such that $m!x$ is an integer.
Thus, $f_m(x)$ has at most finitely many discontinuities in any bounded interval. 
\end{important}
\begin{commentary}
$f_m(x) = \cos m! \pi x$ is discontinuous at $S = \left\{ \frac{k}{m!} \in E : k \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$.
For example, suppose $m = 3$.
Then $S = \left\{ 0,\pm\frac{1}{6},\pm\frac{2}{6},\pm\frac{3}{6},\pm\frac{4}{6},\pm\frac{5}{6},\pm 1 \right\}$.
\end{commentary}
Let $\alpha$ be the identity function.
Then $\alpha$ is continuous at those finite points where $f_m$ is discontinuous.
And $f_m$ are bounded functions, since $|f_m| \le 1$.
Therefore, for any bounded interval $E$, $f_m$ is Riemann integrable on $E$ for each $m$.
However, $f$ is not Riemann integrable.
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Derivative}
\[ \sequence{f_n} \to f \nimplies \sequence{f_n'} \to f' \]
\begin{proof}
	Consider $f_n(x) = \frac{\sin nx}{\sqrt{n}}$.
	\[ f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = 0,\ \forall x \]
	However, $f_n'(x) = \sqrt{n} \cos nx$.
	And $f'(x) = 0$.
	\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{d}{dx} f_n(x) = \infty \ne f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x),\ \forall x \]
	Clearly, convergence doesn't preserve derivatives.
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Integral}
\[ \sequence{f_n} \to f \nimplies \sequence{ \int f_n} \to \int f \]
\begin{proof}
	Consider $f_n : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f_n(x) = n^2 x (1-x^2)^n$.\\

	We have,
	\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^\alpha}{(1+p)^n} = 0 \]
	Let $\frac{1}{1+p} = 1-x^2$, then $1+p = \frac{1}{1-x^2}$ and $p = \frac{x^2}{1-x^2} > 0$.\\
	Now, we have
	\[ f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} n^2 x(1-x^2)^n = x \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^2}{\left(1+\frac{x^2}{1-x^2}\right)^n} = 0 \]
	And, we have
	\[ \int_0^1 f(x)\ dx = 0 \]
	However,
	\[ \int_0^1 f_n(x)\ dx = n^2 \int_0^1 x(1-x^2)^n\ dx = n^2 \int_0^1 \frac{u^n}{2}\ du = n^2 \left[ \frac{u^{n+1}}{2(n+1)} \right]_0^1 = \frac{n^2}{2n+2} \]
	Clearly, 
	\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0^1 f_n(x)\ dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^2}{2n+2} = \infty \ne 0 = \int_0^1 f(x)\ dx = \int_0^1 \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)\ dx \]
\end{proof}
\subsection{Uniform Convergence}
Uniform convergence is a partial solution to our main problem.
\begin{definition}
	Let sequence $\sequence{f_n}$ be a sequence of functions on $E$.
	Then $\sequence{f_n}$ converges uniformly to limit function $f$ if for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for any $n > N$ and $x \in E$, $|f_n(x) - f(x)| \le \varepsilon$.
\end{definition}
\begin{important}
	\[ \forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists N \in \mathbb{N},\ \forall n > N,\ \forall x \in E,\ |f_n(x) - f(x)| \le \varepsilon \]
\end{important}
\begin{commentary}
	The difference between pointwise convergence and uniform convergence is that the choice of natrual number $N$ is independent of the choice of $x$ in the case of uniform convergence.
\end{commentary}
\subsubsection{Criterion for Uniform Convergence}
\begin{theorem}[Cauchy criterion]
	The sequence of functions $\sequence{f_n}$ defined on $E$ converges uniformly on $E$ if and only if for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for any $m,n \ge N$ and $x \in E$, $|f_n(x)-f_m(x)| \le \varepsilon$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $E$.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Then there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n,m > N$ and $\forall x \in E$, $|f_n(x) - f(x)| \le \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and $|f_m(x)-f(x)| \le \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$.
	Therefore, $\forall \varepsilon > 0$ we have, $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n,m > N$ and $\forall x \in E$,
	\[ |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| \le |f_n(x)-f(x)| + |f_m(x)-f(x)| \le \varepsilon \]

	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Suppose there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n,m > N$ and $\forall x \in E$,
	\[ |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| \le |f_n(x)-f(x)| + |f_m(x)-f(x)| \le \varepsilon \]
	By Cauchy criterion, $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ pointwise on $E$.
	It remains to prove that this convergence is uniform on $E$.
	Clearly, above inequality is true for any value of $m$ greater than $N$.
	As $m \to \infty$ we have,
	\begin{align*}
		\lim_{m \to \infty} |f_n(x) - f_m(x)|  \le \varepsilon \\
		\implies \left|f_n(x) - \lim_{m \to \infty} f_m(x)\right| = |f_n(x) - f(x) | & \le \varepsilon
	\end{align*}
	Clearly, the convergence is uniform.
	That is, $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $E$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Supremum Test]
	Suppose sequence of function $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ pointwise on $E$.
	Suppose $\displaystyle M_n = \sup_{x \in E} \left|f_n(x) - f(x)\right|$.
	Then $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $E$, if and only if sequence $\sequence{M_n} \to 0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Define $\displaystyle M_n = \sup_{x \in X} |f_n(x) - f(x)|$.
	Clearly, $M_n \ge 0$.
	Suppose $\sequence{M_n} \to 0$ on $E$.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Then there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $n > N$,  we have $|M_n - 0| = M_n \le \varepsilon$.
	Thus for any $n \ge N$ and $x \in E$,
	\[ |f_n(x) - f(x)| \le \sup |f_n(x) - f(x)| = M_n \le \varepsilon \]
	Therefore, $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $E$.\\

	Suppose $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $E$.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Then, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $n \ge N$ and $x \in E$, $|f_n(x) -f(x)| \le \varepsilon$.
	This inequality is true for every $x \in E$.
	Thus,
	\[ \sup_{x \in E} \left| f_n(x) - f(x) \right| = M_n \le \varepsilon,\quad \forall n \ge N \]
	Therefore, $\sequence{M_n} \to 0$ on $E$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Weierstrass M-test]
	Suppose $\sequence{f_n}$ is a sequence of functions on $E$.
	Suppose $|f_n(x)| \le M_n$.
	Then $\sum f_n$ converges on $E$ if $\sum M_n$ converges.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $|f_n| \le M_n$.
	Then $M_n \ge 0$.
	Suppose $\sum M_n$ converges.
	Let $\sequence{s_n}$ be the sequence of partial sums.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	By Cauchy criterion, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n,m \ge N$, $|s_n - s_m| \le \varepsilon$.
	Thus,
	\[ |s_n - s_m| = \left| \sum_{j = 1}^n M_j - \sum_{j = 1}^m M_j \right| =  \sum_{j = n+1}^m M_j \le \varepsilon,\quad ( m > n )\]
	Let $\sequence{S_n}$ be the sequence of partial sums for $\sum f_n$.
	Clearly, $\forall n,m \ge N$ and $\forall x \in E$, we have $|S_n-S_m| \le \varepsilon$ since
	\[ |S_n - S_m| = \left|\sum_{j = 1}^n f_j(x) - \sum_{j = 1}^m f_j(x) \right| = \left| \sum_{j = n+1}^m f_j(x) \right| \le \sum_{j = n+1}^m M_j \le \varepsilon \]
	By Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence, the sequence of partial sums, $\sequence{S_n}$ converges uniformly on $E$.
	Therefore, the series of functions, $\sum f_n$ converges uniformly on $E$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Uniform Convergence and Continuity}
\begin{theorem} %7.11
	Suppose $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $E$.
	Let $x$ be a limit point of $E$.
	Suppose $\displaystyle \lim_{t \to x} f_n(t) = A_n$.
	Then $\sequence{A_n}$ converges, and 
	$\displaystyle \lim_{t \to x} f(t) = \lim_{n \to \infty} A_n$.
	In other words,
	\[ \lim_{t \to x} \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(t) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{t \to x} f_n(t) \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $E$.
	Suppose $\displaystyle \lim_{t \to x} f_n(t)  = A_n$ on $E$.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	By Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $n \ge N$ and every $t \in E$, $|f_n(t)-f_m(t)| \le \varepsilon/3$.
	As $t \to x$, we have $|A_n - A_m| \le \varepsilon/3$.
	Clearly, $\sequence{A_n}$ is Cauchy and $\sequence{A_n} \to A$.\\

	Now fix a natural number $N$ such that for every $n \ge N$ and $t \in E$, $|f_n(t) - f(t) | < \varepsilon /3$ and $|A_n-A| \le \varepsilon/3$.
	Also, choose a neighbourhood $V$ of $x$ such that $|f_n(t) - A_n | \le \varepsilon/3$.
	Then, $\forall x \in V \cap E$ we have
	\[ |f(t) - A| \le |f(t) -f_n(t)| + |f_n(t)-A_n| + |A_n - A| \le \varepsilon \]
	Therefore, $\displaystyle \lim_{t \to x} f(t) = A$.
	\[ \lim_{t \to x} \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(t) = \lim_{t \to x} f(t)  = \lim_{n \to \infty} A_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{t \to x} f_n(t) \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} %7.12
	If $\sequence{f_n}$ is a sequence of continuous functions on $E$, and if $f_n \to f$ uniformly on $E$, then $f$ is continuous on $E$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{important}
	Uniform convergence preserves continuity.
\end{important}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose the sequence of continuous functions, $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $E$.
	Since $f_n$ is continuous $\lim_{t \to x} f_n(t) = f_n(x),\ \forall x \in E$.
	Since the convergence is uniform, the order of limits can be interchanged.
	\[ f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{t \to x} f_n(t) = \lim_{t \to x} \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(t) = \lim_{t \to x} f(t) \]
	Therefore, the limit function $f$ is continuous.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
	Suppose a sequence of continuous functions $\sequence{f_n}$ converges to a function $f$.
	Function $f$ being continuous doesn't imply that the convergence is uniform.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
	Consider $f_n : (0,1) \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f_n(x) = \frac{1}{nx+1}$.
	Then, $\sequence{f_n} \to 0$.
	Clearly, $f_n,0$ are continuous functions on $(0,1)$.
	However, the convergence is not uniform.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} %7.13
	Suppose $K$ is compact, and
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\sequence{f_n}$ is sequence of continuous functions on $K$
		\item $\sequence{f_n}$ converges pointwise to a continuous function $f$ on $K$.
		\item $f_n(x) \ge f_{n+1}(x),\ \forall x \in K$
	\end{enumerate}
	Then, $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $K$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ pointwise on $K$.
	Let function $g_n = f_n - f$.
	Then, $g_n$ is continuous, $\sequence{g_n} \to 0$ pointwise and $g_n \ge g_{n+1}$.
  	If sequence $\sequence{g_n} \to 0$ uniformly, then sequence $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly.\\

	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Let $K_n$ be the set of all points $x \in K$ such that $g_n(x) \ge \varepsilon$.
	Then $K_n$ is closed, since $g_n$ is continuous.
	And $K_n$ is compact since $K_n$ is a closed subset of a compact set $K$.\\

	Suppose $x \in K_{n+1}$.
	Then $g_{n+1}(x) \ge \varepsilon$.
	We have, $g(x) \ge g_{n+1}(x)$.
	Thus, $g(x) \ge \varepsilon$.
	Therefore, $K_n \supset K_{n+1} \supset \dots$.\\

	Let $x \in K$.
	We have $\sequence{g_n(x)} \to 0$ pointwise.
	Then there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n > N$, $g_n(x) < \varepsilon$.
	Thus, $x \notin K_n,\ \forall n \ge N$.
	Therefore $\cap K_n$ is empty.\\

	Clearly, $K_N$ is empty for some $N \in \mathbb{N}$.
	Thus, $\forall n \ge N$ and $\forall x \in K$ we have, $0 \le g_n(x) < \varepsilon$.
	In other words, $\sequence{g_n}$ converges to $0$ uniformly on $K$.
	Therefore, $\sequence{f_n}$ converges to $f$ uniformly on $K$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition} %7.14
	Let $X$ be a metric space.
	Let $\mathscr{C}(X)$ be the set of all complex valued, continuous, bounded functions on $X$.
	Let $f \in \mathscr{C}(X)$.
	Then \textbf{supremum norm} on $\mathscr{C}(X)$ is defined by
	\[ \| f \| = \sup_{x \in X} |f(x)| \]
	And, $\mathscr{C}(X)$ together with \textbf{distance function} $d : \mathscr{C}(X) \times \mathscr{C}(X) \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $d(f,g) = \| f-g \|$ is a metric space.
\end{definition}

\begin{commentary}
	Let $\mathscr{C}(X)$ be the set of all complex valued, continuous, bounded functions on metric space $X$.
	Let $f \in \mathscr{C}(X)$.
	Then $f$ is bounded, $|f| < \infty$.
	Thus, $\sup |f(x)|$ exists.
	Therefore, $\| f \|$ is well-defined.\\

	And, $\| f \| = \sup |f(x)| \ge 0$ since $|f(x)| \ge 0$.
	Let $f,g \in \mathscr{C}(X)$.
	Then $h = f+g \in \mathscr{C}(X)$ since sum of continuous functions is functions and sum of bounded functions is bounded.
	Also, we have
	\[ \| h \| = \sup_{x \in X} |(f+g)(x)| \le \sup_{x \in X} |f(x)| + \sup_{x \in X} |g(x)| = \| f \| + \| g \| \]
	Therefore, $\| . \| : \mathscr{C}(X) \to \mathbb{R}$ is a norm on $\mathscr{C}(X)$.\\

	Consider the function $d : \mathscr{C}(X) \times \mathscr{C}(X) \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $d(f,g) = \| f-g \|$.
	Clearly, $d(f,g) \ge 0$ since $|(f-g)(x)| \ge 0$.
	And,
	\[ d(f,g) = 0 \iff |(f-g)(x)| = 0, \forall x \in X \iff f =g  \]
	Also we have,
	\[ d(f,g) \le \| (f-h)+(h-g) \| \le \| f-h \| + \| h-g \| =  d(f,h) + d(h,g) \]
	Therefore, the function $d$ is a distance function/metric on $\mathscr{C}(X)$.

\begin{definition}[uniformly closed]
	Closed subset of $\mathscr{C}(X)$ is \textbf{uniformly closed} since every convergent sequence in it corresponds to a uniform convergent sequence in $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[uniform closure]
	Let $\mathscr{A} \subset \mathscr{C}(X)$.
	Then its closure, $\bar{\mathscr{A}}$ is the \textbf{uniform closure} of $\mathscr{A}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[complete metric space]
	A metric space is \textbf{complete} if every Cauchy sequence in it converges.
\end{definition}

For example, $\mathbb{R}$ is complete.
But $\mathbb{Q}$ is not complete since a sequence of rational numbers converging to $\pi$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{Q}$ which doesn't converge to any point in $\mathbb{Q}$.

\begin{theorem} %7.15
	Let $X$ be a metric space.
	Let $\mathscr{C}(X)$ be the set of all complex valued, continuous, bounded functions on $X$.
	Let $f,g \in \mathscr{C}(X)$.
	Define norm $\| f \| = \sup_{x \in X} |f(x)|$ and metric $d(f,g) = \| f-g \|$.
	Then metric space $\entity{\mathscr{C}(X),d}$ is a complete metric space.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let sequence of functions $\sequence{f_n}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $\mathscr{C}(X)$.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Then there exists a natural number $N$ such that for any $n,m > N$, $d(f_n,f_m) < \varepsilon$.
	That is, 
	\[ d(f_n,f_m) = \sup_{x \in X} |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \varepsilon \]
	%Thus, the  inequality is true for any $x \in X$.
	%\[ \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n,m > N, \forall x \in X, |f_n(x)-f_m(x)| <\varepsilon \]
	%Thus, $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $X$.
	Define $M_n = \sup_{x \in X} |f_n(x)|$.
	Then,
	\[ |M_n - M_m| = \left| \sup_{x \in X} |f_n(x)| - \sup_{x \in X}|f_m(x)| \right| \le \sup_{x \in X} |f_n(x) - f_m(x) | < \varepsilon \]
	We have, $\sequence{M_n}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}$.
	We know that, every Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ is convergent in $\mathbb{R}$ since $\mathbb{R}$ is complete.
	Thus, $\sequence{M_n}$ converges.\\

	We have, corresponding  sequence $\sequence{f_n}$ in $X$ such that sequence $\sequence{M_n}$ defined by $M_n = \sup_{x \in X} |f_n(x)|$ converges.
	Therefore, $\sequence{f_n}$ converges to $f$ uniformly on $X$ by criterion of uniform convergence.\\

	We have, $f_n$ are continuous, bounded functions on $X$.
	And $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $X$.
	\[ \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists N \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n > N, \forall x \in X, |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \varepsilon \]
	Since, the convergence is uniform, the limit function $f$ is continuous and \begin{important}bounded\end{important}.
	Therefore, $\sequence{f_n}$ in $\mathscr{C}(X)$ converges to $f \in \mathscr{C}(X)$.\\

	The Cauchy sequence $\sequence{f_n}$ is chosen arbitrarily.
	Thus, every Cauchy sequence in $\mathscr{C}(X)$ is convergent.
	Therefore, $\mathscr{C}(X)$ is complete.

\subsection{Uniform Convergence and Integration}
\begin{theorem} %7.16
	Let $\alpha$ be monotonically increasing on $[a,b]$.
	Suppose $f_n \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
	Suppose $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $[a,b]$.
	Then $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
	And,
	\[ \int_a^b f\ d\alpha = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_a^b f_n \ d\alpha \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f_n \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$.
	Suppose sequence $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $[a,b]$.
	Define
	\[ \varepsilon_n = \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f_n(x) - f(x)| \]
	Then, $ -\varepsilon_n \le f - f_n \le \varepsilon_n,\quad \forall x \in [a,b] $. 
	And,
	\[ f_n - \varepsilon_n \le f \le f_n + \varepsilon_n \]
	Since $f_n \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$, we have $f_n+\varepsilon, f_n - \varepsilon \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$.
	From the definition of lower and upper integrals,
	\[ \int_a^b (f_n - \varepsilon_n)\ d\alpha \le \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha \le \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha \le \int_a^b (f_n + \varepsilon_n)\ d\alpha  \]
	Thus,
	\[ 0 \le \upint_a^b f\ d\alpha - \lowint_a^b f\ d\alpha \le \int_a^b 2\varepsilon_n\ d\alpha = 2\varepsilon_n \left[ \alpha(b)-\alpha(a) \right] \]
	Clearly, $\varepsilon_n \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$.
	Then, $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ since the lower and upper integrals of $f$ with respect to $\alpha$ are equal.\\
	
	Also we have, $ 0 \le |f-f_n| \le \varepsilon_n $ for every $x \in [a,b]$.\\
	Therefore,
	\[ 0 \le \left| \int_a^b f\ d\alpha - \int_a^b f_n\ d\alpha \right| \le \int_a^b |f-f_n|\ d\alpha \le \int_a^b \varepsilon_n\ d\alpha = \varepsilon_n \left[ \alpha(b) - \alpha(a) \right] \]
	As $n \to \infty$, we have $\varepsilon_n \to 0$.
	Thus,
	\[ \int_a^b f\ d\alpha = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_a^b f_n\ d\ \alpha \]
\end{proof} 

\begin{corollary}
	If $f_n \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ and if
	\[ f(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty f_n(x) \]
	the series converging uniformly on $[a,b]$, then
	\[ \int_a^b f\ d\alpha = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \int_a^b f_n \ d\alpha \]
	In other words, the series may be integrated term by term.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $f_n \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ and $\sum f_n$ converges to $f$ uniformly on $[a,b]$.
	Let $\sequence{S_n}$ be the sequence of partial sums converging to $f$ uniformly on $[a,b]$.
	We have, $S_n \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ by linearity of the integral and mathematical induction.
	\[ \sum_{j = 1}^n \int_a^b f_n\ d\alpha = \int_a^b \sum_{j = 1}^n f_j\ d\alpha = \int_a^b S_n\ d\alpha \]
	Since the uniform limit function of integrable functions is integrable,
	\[ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty f_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n  = f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha) \text{ and } \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_a^b S_n\ d\alpha = \int_a^b f\ d\alpha \]
	By the definition of sum of series,
	\[ \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \int_a^b f_n\ d\alpha = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{j = 1}^n \int_a^b f_j\ d\alpha = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_a^b S_n\ d\alpha = \int_a^b f\ d\alpha = \int_a^b \sum_{n = 1}^\infty f_n\ d\alpha \]
	Thus, the series may be integrated term by term.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Uniform Convergence and Differentiation}
\begin{theorem} %7.17
	Suppose $\sequence{f_n}$ is a sequence of functions, differentiable on $[a,b]$ and $\sequence{f_n(x_0)}$ converges for some $x_0 \in [a,b]$.
	If $\sequence{f_n'}$ converges uniformly on $[a,b]$, then $\sequence{f_n}$ converges uniformly on $[a,b]$ to a function $f$.
	And,
	\[ f'(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n'(x) \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $\sequence{f_n(x_0)} \to f(x_0)$.
	Suppose $\sequence{f_n'}$ converges uniformly on $[a,b]$.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Then there exists a natural number $N$ such that
	\[ \forall n,m > N,\ |f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0)| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \text{ and}\] 
	\[ \forall n,m > N,\ |f_n'(t) - f_m'(t)| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2(b-a)} \]
	Let $x,t \in [a,b]$.
	\begin{align*}
		|f_n(x)-f_m(x)-f_n(t)+f_m(t)| & = |(f_n-f_m)(x) - (f_n-f_m)(t)| 
		\intertext{By mean value theorem, there exists $y \in (x,t)$ such that}
		|f_n(x)-f_m(x)-f_n(t)+f_m(t)| & = |(x-t)\ (f_n-f_m)'(y)|\\
		& \le \frac{|x-t|\varepsilon}{2(b-a)} \le \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
	\end{align*}
	since $|(f_n-f_m)'(x)| = |f_n'(x) - f_m'(x)| \le \frac{\varepsilon}{2(b-a)}$. \\

	And the inequality is true of $t = x_0$.
	Thus,
	\begin{align*}
		|f_n(x)-f_m(x)| &
		= |f_n(x)-f_m(x) -f_n(x_0)+f_m(x_0)+f_n(x_0)-f_m(x_0| \\
		& \le |f_n(x)-f_m(x) -f_n(x_0)+f_m(x_0)| + |f_n(x_0)-f_m(x_0| \le \varepsilon
	\end{align*}
	Thus, $\forall \varepsilon > 0$, we have a natural number $N$ such that $\forall n,m > N$, $\forall x \in [a,b]$, $|f_n(x)-f_m(x)| \le \varepsilon$.
	In other words, $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $[a,b]$.\\

	Fix $x \in [a,b]$.
	Define functions $\phi_n,\phi$ on $[a,b]$ except at $t = x$,
	\[ \phi_n(t) = \frac{f_n(t)-f_n(x)}{t-x} \quad \text{ and } \quad \phi(t) = \frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x}\]
	Then,
	\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \phi_n(t) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f_n(t) - f_n(x)}{t-x} = \frac{\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(t) - \displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)}{t-x} = \frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t-x} = \phi(t)\] 
	since sequence $\sequence{f_n} \to f$ uniformly on $[a,b]$.
	Clearly, $\sequence{\phi_n}$ converges to $\phi$ pointwise on $[a,b] - \{ x \}$.\\

	We have,
	\[ \lim_{t \to x}\phi_n(t) = \lim_{t \to x} \frac{f_n(t) - f_n(x)}{t-x} = f_n'(x) \]
	\[ \lim_{t \to x} \phi(t) = \lim_{t \to x} \frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x} = f'(x) \]
	Also we have,
	\[ |\phi_n(t)-\phi_m(t)| = \frac{|f_n(t)-f_n(x)-f_m(t) + f_m(x)|}{t-x} \le \frac{\varepsilon}{2(b-a)} \]
	That is $\forall n,m > N$, $|\phi_n(t)-\phi_m(t)| < \varepsilon$.
	Now, by Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence, sequence $\sequence{\phi_n}$ converges to $\phi$ uniformly on $[a,b]-\{x\}$.\\

	We know that continuity is preserved under uniform convergence.\\
	Therefore,
	\[ f'(t) = \lim_{t \to x} \phi(t) = \lim_{t \to x} \lim_{n \to \infty} \phi_n(t) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{t \to x} \phi_n(t) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n'(x) \]

\end{proof}

	Define $\phi : [-1,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\phi(x) = |x|$.
	Extend $\phi$ from $[-1,1]$ to $\mathbb{R}$ such that $\phi(x+2) = \phi(x)$.
	Then $|\phi(s)-\phi(t)| \le |s-t|,\ \forall s,t \in \mathbb{R}$.\\

	Define $f_n(x) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n \phi(4^n x)$.
	Then $|f_n| \le \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n$.
	By Weierstrass M test, $\displaystyle \sum_{n = 0}^\infty f_n$ converges uniformly on $\mathbb{R}$.
	Consider the function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $\displaystyle f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n \phi(4^n x)$.
	This sum function $f$ is continuous since the convergence is uniform and $f_n$ are all continuous.\\

	Fix a real number $x$ and a positive integer $m$.
	Define $\displaystyle \delta_m = \pm \frac{1}{2}\ 4^{-m}$ such that no integer lies between $4^m x$ and $4^m(x+\delta_m)$.
	This is possible since $|4^m (x+\delta_m) - 4^m x| = |4^m \delta_m| = \frac{1}{2}$.\\

	\begin{commentary}
		The choice of sign of $\delta_m$ is made depending on the value of $4^m x$.
		Suppose $x = 1.1$ and $m = 3$.
		Then $4^m x = 70.4$.
		Now $\delta = \frac{1}{2}\ 4^{-m} = \frac{1}{128}$ so that $4^m(x+\delta_m)= 70.9$.
		Suppose $x = 1.2$ and $m = 3$.
		Then $4^m x = 76.8$.
		Now $\delta = -\frac{1}{2}\ 4^{-m} = -\frac{1}{128}$ so that $4^m(x+\delta) = 76.3$.\\
	\end{commentary}

	Define
	\[\gamma_n = \frac{\phi(4^n(x+\delta_m)) - \phi(4^n x)}{\delta_m} \]

	If $n > m$, then $4^n \delta_m$ is an even integer and $\gamma_n = 0$.\\
	If $n \le m$, then 
	\[ |\gamma_n| = \left|\frac{\phi(4^n(x+\delta_m)) - \phi(4^n x)}{\delta_m} \right| \le \frac{4^n \delta_m }{\delta_m} \le 4^n \]
	since $|\phi(s)-\phi(t)| \le |s-t|$.\\
	In particular, if $n = m$, then
	\[ |\gamma_m| = \left| \frac{\phi(4^m(x+\delta_m))-\phi(4^m x)}{\delta_m} \right| = 4^m \]
	since $|\phi(4^m (x+\delta_m)) - \phi(4^m x)| = |4^m \delta| = \frac{1}{2}$ as there are no integers between $4^m(x+\delta_m)$ and $4^m x$.\\

	From the definition of $\gamma_n$ we have,
	\begin{align*}
	 \left| \frac{f(x+\delta_m) - f(x)}{\delta_m} \right| 
		& = \left| \sum_{n = 0}^m \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^n \gamma_n \right| \\
		& = \left| 3^m + \sum_{n = 0}^{m-1} \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^n \gamma_n \right| \\
		& \ge 3^m - \sum_{n = 0}^{m-1} 3^n = \frac{3^m+1}{2}
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, the function $f$ is not differentiable at $x$ since the following limit does not exist as $m \to \infty$.
	\[ \lim_{\delta_m \to 0} \left| \frac{f(x+\delta_m) - f(x)}{\delta_m} \right| \ge \lim_{m \to \infty} \frac{3^m+1}{2} \]
	Since the choice of $x$ is arbitrary, the function $f$ is nowhere differentiable.

\subsection{Two Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Whether uniform bounded sequence of uniformly bounded functions have a convergent subsequence ?
		\textbf{NO}.\\
		Sequence $\sequence{f_n}$ where $f_n(x) = \sin nx$ is uniformly bounded.
		But it doesn't have a convergent subseqeunce.
		\begin{proof}
			Suppose $\sequence{\sin nx}$ has a convergent subsequence, say $\sequence{\sin n_kx}$.
			Then by Cauchy criterion, $(\sin n_k x - \sin n_{k+1}x) \to 0$ as $n_k \to \infty$.
			\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \sin n_k x - \sin n_{k+1}x = 0 \]
			\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} (\sin n_k x - \sin n_{k+1}x)^2 = 0 \]
			By Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem,
			\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0^{2\pi} (\sin n_kx - \sin n_{k+1}x)^2 dx = \int_0^{2\pi} \lim_{n \to \infty} (\sin n_kx - \sin n_{k+1}x)^2 dx = 0 \]
			However, the integral on the left evaluates $2\pi$ which is a contradiction.
			Clearly, the uniformly bounded sequence $\sequence{\sin nx}$ of continuous functions on compact interval $[0,2\pi]$ does not even imply existence of a subsequence which converges pointwise.
		\end{proof}
	\item Whether every uniformly bounded, convergent sequence has a  uniformly convergent subsequence ?
		\textbf{NO}.\\
		Consider,
		\[ f_n(x) = \frac{x^2}{x^2+(1-nx)^2} \]
		Sequence $\sequence{f_n}$ is a uniformly bounded sequence of functions on compact interval $[0,1]$.
		doesn't have a convergent subsequence.
		\begin{proof}
			Suppose $\sequence{f_n}$ has a convergent subsequence $\sequence{f_{n_k}} \to f$.
			Then $\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} f_{n_k}(x) = f(x)$.
			We have,
			\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{x^2+(1-nx)^2} = 0 \]
			However,
			\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n \left(\frac{1}{n}\right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2+0} = 1 \ne 0 = \left(\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n\right)(x) \] 
			Clearly, the sequence of functions $\{ f_n\}$ is a uniformly bounded sequence of continuous functions on a compact interval $[0,1]$.
			Therefore, uniformly bounded, convergent sequence on compact set doesn't necessarily have a uniformly convergenct subsequence.
		\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

	By Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem,  $\sequence{f_n(x_1)}$ has a subsequence $S_1$, say $\sequence{f_{1,k}(x_1)}$ which converges at $x_1 \in E$.
	\[ S_1 : f_{1,1}\ f_{1,2}\ f_{1,3} \dots \]

	Consider, the subsequence $\sequence{f_{2,k}(x_2)}$ of the sequence $\sequence{f_n(x_2)}$ with the same values for $k$ as in subsequence $\sequence{f_{1,k}(x_2)}$.
	Again, $\sequence{f_{2,k}(x_2)}$ is a bounded complex sequence.
	And by Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, $\sequence{f_{2,k}(x_2)}$ has a convergent subsequence $S_2$, say $\sequence{f_{2,k'}(x_2)}$ which is a subsequence of $\sequence{f_2(x_2)}$.
	And more importantly, $S_2$ is a subsequence of $S_1$ such that $S_2$ converges for both $x_1,x_2 \in E$.
	\[ S_2 : f_{2,1}\ f_{2,2}\ f_{2,3} \dots \]

	Continuing like this, we get a sequence of subsequences
	\begin{align*}
		S_1 \quad & : f_{n,1}\quad f_{n,2}\quad f_{n,3}\quad \dots \\
		S_2 \quad & : f_{n,1}\quad f_{n,2}\quad f_{n,3}\quad \dots \\
		 & \dots \\
		S_n \quad & : f_{n,1}\quad f_{n,2}\quad f_{n,3}\quad \dots
	\end{align*}

	Consider the diagonal sequence, $S : f_{1,1}\ f_{2,2}\ f_{3,3} \dots $.
	We know that discarding finitely many first terms won't affect convergence of sequences.
	And for any natural number $n$, we have can obtain a subsequence of $S_n$ by discarding a finite number of first terms from $S$.
	Thus, we have sequence $S$ which converges for $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n \in E$ since $S_n$ converges.
	Therefore, as $n \to \infty$ we have a convergent subsequence $S$ of $\sequence{f_n}$ which converges for every $x \in E$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $K$ be a compact metric space.
	If $\sequence{f_n}$ is a sequence of pointwise bounded, continuous, complex valued functions on $K$ converges uniformly on $K$, then $\sequence{f_n}$ is equicontinuous on $K$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $K$ be a compact metric space.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Let $\sequence{f_n}$ converges uniformly on $K$.
	Then,
	\[ \forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } \forall n > N,\ \forall x \in K,\ \| f_n(x)-f_N(x) \| < \varepsilon \]

	We have continuous functions on compact sets are uniformly continuous.
	Thus for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exist $\delta > 0$ such that $|f_j(x) - f_j(y)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $d(x,y) < \delta$.
	Thus, $|f_N(x) - f_N(y)| \le \varepsilon$.\\

	Let $1 \le j \le N$.
	Since the continuity is uniform, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|f_j(x) - f_j(y)| < \varepsilon$.\dag\footnote{
		For each functions $f_j$, given $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta_j > 0$ satisfying the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ condition for uniform continuity.
		Define $\delta = \min \{ \delta_j : j = 1,2,\dots,N \}$, then for this $\delta$ the condition is satified by functions $f_1,f_2,\dots,f_N$.}\\

	Let $n > N$ and $d(x,y) < \delta$.
	Then,
	\[ |f_n(x)-f_n(y)| \le |f_n(x)-f_N(x)| + |f_N(x) - f_N(y)| + |f_N(y) - f_n(y)| < 3\varepsilon \]

	Therefore, for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $\forall n \in \mathbb{N},\ |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $d(x,y)< \delta$.
	\[ \forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists \delta > 0,\ \forall n \in \mathbb{N},\!\! \underset{d(x,y) < \delta}{\forall} \!\!\!\! y \in K,\ |f_n(x)-f_n(y)| < \varepsilon \]
	That is, the sequence $\sequence{f_n}$ is equicontinuous on $K$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $K$ a compact.
	If $\sequence{f_n}$ be a sequence of pointwise bounded, equicontinuous, complex functions on $K$, then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\sequence{f_n}$ is uniformly bounded on $K$.
		\item $\sequence{f_n}$ has a uniformly convergent subsequence.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\sequence{f_n}$ be sequence of point-wise bounded, equicontinuous, complex functions on compact set $K$.
	Since $f_n$ are equicontinuous, given $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $\forall n \in \mathbb{N},\ |f_n(x)-f_n(y)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $d(x,y) < \delta$.\\

	Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a cover of $K$ of open balls of radius $\delta$.
	Since, $K$ is compact this cover has a finite subcover, say open balls with center $p_j,\ j = 1,2,\dots,r$.
	Thus there exists finitely many points, $p_j$ such that every point in $K$ is sufficiently close one of them.
	Then for any $x \in K$, there exists some $p_j$ such that $d(x,p_j) < \delta$.\\

	Since $\sequence{f_n}$ is point-wise bounded, there exists $M_j$ such that $|f_n(p_j)| < M_j$.
	Define $M = \max \{ M_1, M_2, \dots, M_r\}$. 
	Then 
	\begin{align*}
		|f_n(x)| & = |f_n(x)-f_n(p_j)+f_n(p_j)| \\
		& \le |f_n(x) - f_n(p_j)| + |f_n(p_j)| \\
		& \le \varepsilon + M
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, $\sequence{f_n}$ is uniformly bounded.\\

	\hrule \vspace{1em}

	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Choose $\delta > 0$ such that $|f_n(x)-f_n(y)| < \varepsilon$ whenever $d(x,y) < \delta$.
	Since $K$ is compact, $K$ has a countable dense subset, say $E = \{x_1,x_2,\dots\}$.
	That is, given $\delta > 0$, for any $x \in K$, there exists $x_j \in E$ such that $d(x,x_j) < \delta$.
	Clearly, $K$ has a cover of open balls with center $x_j$s and radius $\delta$.
	Since $K$ is compact, there exists finitely many points $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_m \in E$ such that $d(x,x_m) < \delta$.\\

	Since $E$ is countable and $\sequence{f_n}$ is point-wise bounded, $\sequence{f_n}$ on $E$ has a subsequence, say diagonal sequence $f_{n_i} = g_i$ which converges for any $x_j \in E$.
	Thus, by Cauchy criterion there exists integer $N$ such that 
	\[ \forall i,j \ge N,\ |g_i(x_s) - g_j(x_s)| < \varepsilon,\quad s = 1,2,\dots,m \]

	Let $x \in K$.
	Let $x_s \in E$ such that $d(x,x_s) < \delta$.
	Then,
	\[ |g_i(x) - g_j(x)| \le |g_i(x)-g_i(x_s)| + |g_i(x_s) - g_j(x_s)| + |g_j(x_s) - g_j(x)| \le 3\varepsilon \]
	That is, $\sequence{g_i}$ is uniformly convergent on $K$.
	Therefore, $\sequence{f_n}$ has a uniformly convergent subseqeunce $\sequence{f_{n_k}}$.

\begin{theorem}[Weierstrass' Theorem]
	If $f$ is a continuous, complex function on $[a,b]$, there exists a sequence of polynomials $P_n$ such that
	\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} P_n(x) = f(x) \]
	uniformly on $[a,b]$.
	If $f$ is real, the $P_n$ may be taken real.
\end{theorem}
\begin{important}
In other words, any continuous function has a polynomial approximation.
\end{important}
\begin{proof}
	Without loss of generality, suppose $[a,b] = [0,1]$ and $f(0) = f(1) = 0$.\\

	\textbf{Step 1 : WLoG $f(0) = f(1) = 0$}
	\begin{commentary}
	If theorem is true for continuous functions satisfying $f(0) = f(1) = 0$, then it is true for any continuous function.\\
	\end{commentary}

	Let $f$ be any continuous function on $[0,1]$.
	Then there exists a function $g : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by,
	\[ g(x) = f(x)-f(0) - x[f(1) - f(0)] \]
	such that $g(0) = g(1) = 0$.
	Suppose $g$ can be expressed as limit function of a uniformly convergent sequence of polynomials, say $P_n$.
	We have,
	\[ (f-g)(x) = x[f(1) - f(0)] + f(0) \]
	is a polynomial, say $P(x)$.
	Then $P_n+P \to f$ uniformly as $n \to \infty$, since $P_n \to g$ uniformly and $P$ is a constant polynomial independent of $n$.
	\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} (P_n+P)(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} P_n(x) + P(x) = g(x) + (f-g)(x) = f(x) \]
	Therefore, it is enough to prove the theorem is true for any continuous function $f$ satisfying $f(0) =f(1) = 0$.\\

	\hrule \vspace{1em}

	\textbf{Step 2 : Construction of $P_n(x)$}\\
	Since $f$ is continous in $[0,1]$, $f$ is uniformly continuous in $[0,1]$.
	Extend $f$ such that $f(x) = 0, \ \forall x \notin [0,1]$.
	Then,  $f$ is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.
	Define $Q_n(x) = c_n(1-x^2)^n$ such that
	\[ \int_{-1}^1 Q_n(x) \ dx = 1 \]
	Then we have,
	\begin{align*}
		\int_{-1}^1 (1-x^2)^n \ dx 
		& = 2\int_0^1 (1-x^2)^n \ dx \ \text{ since } (1-x^2)^n \text{ is even} 
		\intertext{We have, Bernouli's inequality. $(1+x)^r \ge (1+rx),\ \forall x \ge -1,\ \forall r \ge 0$}
		\int_{-1}^1 (1-x^2)^n \ dx 
		& \ge 2\int_0^{1/\sqrt{n}} (1-nx^2) \ dx \\
		& \ge 2 \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} - \frac{n}{3n\sqrt{n}} \right) = \frac{4}{3\sqrt{n}} > \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
	\end{align*}
	Clearly, $c_n < \sqrt{n}$. \\

	For $\delta > 0$, $Q_n(x) \le \sqrt{n}(1-\delta^2)^n$ for $\delta \le |x| \le 1$.	
	Then $Q_n \to Q$ uniformly for all such that $\delta \le |x| \le 1$.
	Define $P_n : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by 
	\[ P_n(x) = \int_{-1}^1 f(x+t) \ Q_n(t) \ dt \]
	Then,
	\begin{align*}
		P_n(x) & = \int_{-1}^1 f(x+t) \ Q_n(t) \ dt \\
		& = \int_{-x}^{1-x} f(x+t) \ Q_n(t) \ dt \text{ since } f \text{ vanishes outside } [0,1]\\
		& = \int_0^{1} f(t) \ Q_n(t-x) \ dt 
	\end{align*}
	{\color{red}
	Continuous function $f$ is uniformly continuous on compact interval $[0,1]$.
	Thus $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$.
	And $Q_n(t-x) = c_n [1-(t+x)^2]^n$.
	From integration by parts, we know that $\sequence{P_n}$ is a sequence of polynomials.
	\begin{align*}
		P_n(x) 
		& = \int_0^1 f(t) Q_n(t+x) dt \\
		& = \left[f(t)Q_n'(t+x)\right]_0^1 - \int_0^1 Q_n'(t+x) \int_0^1 f(t) dt\\
		& = f(1)Q_n'(1+x) -f(0)Q_n'(x) - [F(1)-F(0)]\int_0^1 Q_n'(t+x) dt \\
		& = f(1)Q_n'(1+x) - f(0)Q_n'(x) - [F(1)-F(0)] [Q_n(1+x) - Q_n(x)]
	\end{align*}
	}
	And for each natural number $n$, we have $P_n(x)$ is real, if $f$ is real.\\

	\hrule \vspace{1em}

	\textbf{Step 3 : $P_n \to f$ uniformly}\\
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Since extended $f$ is uniformly continuous on real line, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(y)-f(x)| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ whenever $|y-x| < \delta$.
	\begin{align*}
		|P_n(x)-f(x)| 
		& = \left| \int_{-1}^1 f(x+t)Q_n(t)\ dt - f(x)\int_{-1}^1 Q_n(t)\ dt \right| \\
		& \le \int_{-1}^1 |f(x+t)-f(x)| Q_n(t)\ dt 
		\intertext{Let $M =\sup f(x)$. Then $|f(x+t)-f(x)| \le 2M$. And we have an upper bound for the value $Q_n(x)$ for $\delta \le |x| \le 1$. Therefore, we split the domain of integral into three parts so that we may apply uniform continuity on the middle part and bound of $Q_n$ on other two parts.}
		|P_n(x)-f(x)| 
		& \le 2M \int_{-1}^{-\delta} Q_n(t)dt + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \int_{-\delta}^{\delta} Q_n(t)dt+2M\int_{\delta}^1 Q_n(t)dt 
		\intertext{We have an upper bound for $Q_n$, say $Q_n(x) \le \sqrt{n}(1-\delta^2)^n$ for $\delta \le |x| \le 1$.}
		|P_n(x)-f(x)| 
		& \le 2M\sqrt{n}(1-\delta^2)^n \int_{-1}^{-\delta} dt + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \int_{-\delta}^{\delta} Q_n(t)dt+2M \sqrt{n} (1-\delta^2)^n \int_{\delta}^1 dt \\
		& \le 4M\sqrt{n}(1-\delta^2)^n + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \quad \text{ since } 2(1-\delta) < 2 \\
		& \le \varepsilon \text{ for sufficiently large n}
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n > N,\ |P_n(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon$.
	In other words, $P_n \to f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	For every interval $[-a,a]$ there is a sequence of real polynomials $P_n$ such that $P_n(0) = 0$ and
	\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} P_n(x) = |x| \]
	uniformly on $[-a,a]$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	By Weierstrass theorem, there exists a sequence $\sequence{P_n^\ast(x)}$ of real polynomials which converges to $|x|$ uniformly on $[-a,a]$.
	Thus, $P_n^\ast(0) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$.
	Define $P_n(x) = P_n^\ast(x) - P_n^\ast(0)$.
	Clearly, $P_n(0) = 0$ and the sequence $\sequence{P_n(x)}$ converges uniformly on $[-a,a]$.
	And,
	\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} P_n(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} P_n^\ast(x) - \lim_{n \to \infty}P_n^\ast(0) = |x| \]	
	Therefore, $P_n(0) = 0$ and $P_n(x) \to |x|$ as $n \to \infty$.

\begin{definition}[analytic function]
	A function $f$ is (real) analytic if it can be represented by a power series.
	\[ f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty c_n x^n \]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	The open interval in which a power series $\sum c_n x^n$ converges is the \textbf{interval of convergence}.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
	Suppose series $\sum c_n x^n$ converges for $|x| < R$.
	Suppose function $f : (-R,R)$ is defined by \[ f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n x^n,\ |x| < R \]
	Then,for any $\varepsilon > 0$, the series $\sum c_n x^n$ converges uniformly on $[-R+\varepsilon,R-\varepsilon]$.
	Also the function $f$ is continuous and differentiable in $(-R,R)$ and
	\[ f'(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty nc_n x^{n-1},\quad |x| < R \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Then for $|x| \le R - \varepsilon$ we have $|c_n x^n| \le |c_n (R-\varepsilon)^n|$.\\

	We have, 
	\[ \limsup_{n \to \infty} |R-\varepsilon| \sqrt[n]{|c_n|} = (R-\varepsilon) \limsup_{n \to\infty} \sqrt[n]{|c_n|} = 0 < 1 \]

	By raio test, the series $\sum c_n (R-\varepsilon)^n$ converges absolutely.
	By Weierstrass M test, series $\sum c_n x^n$ converges uniformly on $[-R+\varepsilon,R-\varepsilon]$.
	In the same fashion, the series $\sum nc_n x^{n-1}$ converges uniformly on $[-R+\varepsilon,R-\varepsilon]$ since $\displaystyle \limsup_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{n|c_n|} = 0$.\\

	Let $x_0 \in (-R,R)$.
	Then there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $x_0 \in [-R+\varepsilon, R-\varepsilon]$.
	The series $\sum n c_n x^{n-1}$ converges to $f'(x)$ uniformly on $[-R+\varepsilon,R-\varepsilon]$ and $f(x_0) = \sum c_n x_0^n$.
	Thus, $f$ is differentiable on $[-R+\varepsilon,R-\varepsilon]$ and
	\[ f'(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n k c_k x^{k-1} = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty n c_n x^{n-1} \]
	We know that $f$ is continuous at a point if it is differentiable at that point.
	Thus, $f$ is continuous on $[-R+\varepsilon,R-\varepsilon]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	Suppose $\displaystyle \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n x^n$ converges for $|x| < R$ and function $f$ is defined by $f(x) = \displaystyle \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n x^n$.
	Then $f$ has derivatives of all ordres, say $f^{(k)}(x)$ given by
	\[ f^{(k)}(x) = \sum_{n=k}^\infty n(n-1)\dots(n-k+1)c_n x^{n-k} \]
	In particular,
	\[ f^{(k)}(0) = k!\ c_k \]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f(x) = \sum c_n x^n$.
	Then, we have 
	\[ f'(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty n c_n x^n \]
	By mathematical induction, we have
	\[ f^{(k)}(x) = \sum_{n = k}^\infty n(n-1)\dots(n-k+1) c_n x^{n-k} \]
	When $x = 0$, we get
	\[ f^{(k)}(0) = \sum_{n = k}^\infty n(n-1)\dots(n-k+1) c_n 0^{n-k} = {\color{red}k!\ c_k} \]

\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $s_n = c_0 + c_1 + \dots + c_n$ and $s_{-1} = 0$.
	Suppose $\sum c_n$ converges, then $s_n$ converges, say $s_n \to s$.

	\[ \lim_{x_n \to x_0} f_i(x_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij} = \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_{ij} = f_i(x_0) \]
	}
	Therefore, function $f_i$ is continuous at $x_0$.\\

	\textbf{Step 3 : Construction of $g$}\\
	Given $|f_i(x)| < b_i$ and $\sum b_i$ converges.
	Thus, $\sum f_i(x)$ converges.
	Define $g : E \to \mathbb{R}$ such that
	\[ g(x) = \sum_{i = 1}^\infty f_i(x) \]
	Since $f_i$ are continuous functions defined on a countable set $E$, the convergence is uniform and the sum $g$ is continuous.
	And we have,
	\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{m \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^m f_i(x_n) = \lim_{x_n \to x_0} g(x_n) = g(x_0) = \lim_{m \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^m f_i(x_0) = \lim_{m \to \infty} \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^m f_i(x_n) \]

	Therefore,
	\[ \sum_{i=1}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^\infty a_{ij} = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_{ij} \]

\begin{theorem}[Taylor]
	Suppose $f(x) = \sum c_n x^n$, the series converging in $|x| < R$.
	If $-R < a < R$, then $f$ can be expanded in a power series about the point $x = a$ which converges in $|x-a| < R-|a|$.
	And,
	\[ f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^n,\quad |x-a| < R-|a|\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose 
	\begin{align*}
		f(x)
		& = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n[(x-a)+a]^n \\
		& = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n \sum_{m=0}^n  \binom{n}{m} a^{n-m}(x-a)^m 
		%& = \lim_{k \to \infty} \sum_{n=0}^k c_n \sum_{m=0}^n  \binom{n}{m} a^{n-m}(x-a)^m 
		\intertext{Changing the order of summation, we may combine coefficients of $(x-a)^m$.}
		%& = \lim_{k \to \infty} \sum_{m=0}^k \sum_{n = m}^k \binom{n}{m} c_n a^{n-m} (x-a)^m \\
		& = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \sum_{n = m}^\infty \binom{n}{m} c_n a^{n-m} (x-a)^m
	\end{align*}

	Therefore, it is enough to prove that the order of summation can be changed.
	We know that the order of summation can be changed if,
	\[ \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \sum_{m = 0}^n \left| c_n \binom{n}{m} a^{n-m} (x-a)^m \right| \text{ converges} \]
	We know that,
	\[ \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \sum_{m = 0}^n \left| c_n \binom{n}{m} a^{n-m} (x-a)^m \right| = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty |c_n|\ (|x-a|+|a|)^n \]
	and it converges if $|x-a|+|a| < R-|a|$.\\

	Also we know that, if $f(x) = \sum c_n x^n$ converges in $|x|<R$, then the convergence is uniform in $[-R+\varepsilon,R-\varepsilon]$ and it is differentiable in $(-R,R)$.
	And the derivatives are given by,
	\[ f^{(m)}(a) = \sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac{n!}{(n-m)!}c_n a^{n-m} = m! \sum_{n=m}^\infty \binom{n}{m} c_n a^{n-m} \]
	Thus,
	\[ f(x) = \sum_{m = 0}^\infty \sum_{n = m}^\infty c_n\binom{n}{m} a^{n-m} (x-a)^m = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(m)}(a)}{m!}(x-a)^m \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Suppose the series $\sum a_n x^n$ and $\sum b_n x^n$converge in the segment $S = (-R,R)$.
	Let $E$ be the set of all $x \in S$ at which
	\[ \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n x^n \]
	If $E$ has a limit point on $S$, then $a_n = b_n$.

\begin{theorem}
	Let $e^x$ be defined on $\mathbb{R}$.
	Then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $e^x$ is continuous and differentiable for all $x$.
		\item $(e^x)' = e^x$
		\item $e^x$ is a strictly increasing function
		\item $e^{x+y} = e^x e^y$
		\item $e^x \to +\infty$ as $x \to \infty$ an d $e^x \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$ and $e^x \to 0$ as $x \to -\infty$
		\item $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} x^ne^{-x} = 0$ for every $n$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\displaystyle E(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{k!}$.\\

	We know that,	
	\[ E(1) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1^n}{n!} = e \quad \text{and} \quad E(0) = 1 \]

	And,
	\begin{align*}
		E(z)E(w) & = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!} \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{w^m}{m!} \\
		& = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k w^{n-k}}{k!(n-k)!}  \\
		& = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{n}{k} z^k w^{n-k} \\
		& = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(z+w)^n}{n!} \\
		& = E(z+w)
	\end{align*}

	Then we have,
	\[ E(z)E(-z) = E(0) = 1 \]

	We $E(1) = e > 1$.
	Let $M$ be any integer.
	Then $E(M) = e^M > M$.
	Thus there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $E(x) > M$.
	Therefore, $E(x) \to +\infty$ as $x \to +\infty$.\\

	From definition, $E(x) > 0$ for any $x > 0$.
	And for any $x < 0$, $-x > 0$ and $E(-x) > 0$.
	Therefore, $E(x) = 1/E(-x) > 0$.
	Thus, $E(z) > 0$ for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
	Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
	Then there exists an integer $M$ such that $\varepsilon > 1/M$.
	We know that there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $E(x) > M$.
	Then, $0 < E(-x) = 1/E(x) < 1/M < \varepsilon$.
	Thus, $E(x) \to 0$ as $x \to -\infty$.\\

	\begin{align*}
		E'(z) & = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{E(z+h)-E(z)}{h} \\
		& = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{E(z)E(h) - E(z)}{h} \\
		& = E(z) \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{E(h)-1}{h} \\
		& = E(z) \lim_{h \to 0} (h+\frac{h^2}{2!}+\frac{h^3}{3!} + \dots )/ h \\
		& = E(z) 
	\end{align*}
	Thus, $E(x)$ is differentiable at every $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
	Therefore, $E(x)$ is continuous at every $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
	Thus, the function $E : \mathbb{R} \to (0,\infty)$ is strictly increasing.\\

	By mathematical induction
	\[ E(z_1 + z_2 + \dots + z_n) = E(z_1) E(z_2) \dots E(z_n) \]
	Thus,
	\[ E(n) = E(1)^n = e^n,\ \forall n \in \mathbb{N} \]
	Also we have,
	\[ E(-1) = \frac{1}{E(1)} = E(1)^{-1} = e^{-1} \]

	\[ E(-n) = E(-1)^n = \frac{1}{E(n)^n} = E(1)^{-n} = e^{-n},\ \forall n \in \mathbb{N} \]
	Thus,
	\[ E(n) = e^n,\ \forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \]

	Let $p \in \mathbb{Q}$.
	Then $p = n/m$.
	And,
	\[ E(p)^m = E(mp) = E(n) = e^n \implies E(p) = e^p,\ \forall p \in \mathbb{Q} \]

	Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
	Define 
	\[ E(x) = \sup_{p < x,\ p \in \mathbb{Q}} E(p) \]

	By continuity and monotonicity of $E$, we have $E(x) = e^x,\ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$.
	Now rewriting the results, we get
	\begin{eqnarray}
		e^{x+y} &= e^x e^y \\
		\frac{d}{dx} e^x &= e^x 
	\end{eqnarray}

	We have,
	\begin{align*}
		e^x 
		& = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!} \\
		& > \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \\
		x^n e^{-x}
		& < \frac{(n+1)!}{x} \\
		\lim_{x \to \infty} x^n e^{-x} & < (n+1)! \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0,\ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
	\end{align*}
	Thus, $x^n e^{-x} \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$.
	As $x \to +\infty$, $e^{x} \to +\infty$ faster than any positive power $x$.
	\begin{important}
		This is no surprise since $E(1) = e > 1 = E(0)$.
	\end{important}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	The function $E : \mathbb{R} \to (0,\infty)$ is a bijection.
	Thus, there exists an inverse function $L : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $E \circ L = I_{(0,\infty)}$ and $L \circ E = I_\mathbb{R}$ such that 
	\[ L(y) = \int_1^y \frac{1}{x} dx \]
	
	Furthermore, $L(x) \to +\infty$ as $x \to +\infty$ and $L(x) \to 0$ as $x \to -\infty$.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
	Let $u,v \in (0,\infty)$.
	Then there exists $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $E(x) = u$ and $E(y) = v$.
	Thus,
	\[ L(uv) = L(E(x)E(y)) = L(E(x+y)) = x+y \]

	Let $y = E(x)$.
	We have, $L(E(x)) = x$.
	And $L'(E(x)) E'(x) = yL'(y) = 1$ since $E'(x) = E(x) = y$.
	Thus, $L'(y) = 1/y$.\\

	From fundamental theorem for calculus,we have
	\[ \int_a^b f(t)\ dt = F(b) - F(a) \]
	where $f = F'$ on $(a,b)$.
	We have $E(x)$ is strictly monotonic and continuous, thus $L(x)$ is monotonic and continuous on $(0,\infty)$.
	And $L(x)$ is Riemann integrable on any interval $[a,b]$ subset of $(0,\infty)$.
	Put $F = L$.
	Then,
	\[ \int_a^b L'(x) dx = \int_a^b \frac{dx}{x} = L(b) - L(a) \]
	We know that $L(1) = 0$.
	Put $a = 1$  and $b = y$.
	Then, \[ L(y) = \int_1^y \frac{dx}{x} \]

	By mathematical induction,
	\[ L(x^m) = mL(x) \ \forall m \in \mathbb{N} \]
	\[ L(x) = L(x^\frac{m}{m}) = L(x^\frac{1}{m})^m = mL(x^\frac{1}{m}) \implies L(x^\frac{1}{m}) = \frac{1}{m}L(x) \]

	Thus, $x^n = E(nL(x))$ and $x^\frac{1}{m} = E(\frac{1}{m}L(x))$.
	And,
	\[ x = E(L(x)) = E(L(\frac{1}{m}x)^m) = E(mL(\frac{1}{m}x))\]
	Therefore,
	\[ x^\alpha = E(\alpha L(x)),\quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R},\ x > 0,\  \forall \alpha \in \mathbb{Q} \]
	Rewriting the relation with $\log x$ instead of $L(x)$ and $e^x$ instead of $E(x)$, we get $x^\alpha = e^{\alpha \log x}$ for any rational $\alpha$.\\

	We have,
	\[ \frac{d}{dx}x^\alpha = \frac{d}{dx} E(\alpha L(x)) = E'(\alpha L(x)) \alpha L'(x) = E(\alpha L(x)) \frac{\alpha}{x} = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1} \]
	Suppose $\alpha \ne -1$.
	For irrational values of $x$, $L(x)$ can be obtained from,
	\[ E(\alpha L(x)) = \int_1^x y^\alpha dy \]

	We have,
	\begin{align*}
		x^{-\alpha}\log x & = x^{-\alpha} \int_1^x t^{-1}\ dt \\
		& < x^{-\alpha} \int_t^x t^{\varepsilon-1}\ dt \\
		& < x^{-\alpha} \frac{x^\varepsilon -1}{\varepsilon}
	\end{align*}
	Clearly, 
	\[ \lim_{x \to +\infty} x^{-\alpha} \log x  = 0 \]
	As $x \to +\infty$, we have $\log x \to +\infty$ slower than any positive power of $x$.
