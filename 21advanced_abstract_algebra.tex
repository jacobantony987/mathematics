\begin{theorem}[Kronecker]
	Let $F$ be field.
	And $f(x)$ be a non-constant polynomial in $F[x]$.
	Then there exists an extension field $E$ of $F$ and an $\alpha \in E$ such that $f(\alpha) = 0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f(x) \in F[x]$.
	Then $f(x)$ has a unique factorisation into irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$ (except for order and unit).
	Let $p(x)$ be an irreducible factor of $f(x)$.
	If $f(x)$ is irreducible over $F$, then $f(x) = cp(x)$.
	It is enough to construct an extension field $E$ containing both $F$ and $\alpha$ such that ${\color{red}p}(\alpha) = 0$.\\


	If $p(x)$ is irreducible over $F$, then $\generator{p(x)}$ is maximal ideal in $F[x]$.
	Therefore, $F[x]/\\generator{p(x)}$ is a field, say $E$.\\


	Consider the function $\psi : F \to F[x]/\generator{p(x)}$ defined by $\psi(a) = a+\generator{p(x)}$.
	We claim that $\psi : F \to \psi[F]$ is a field isomorphism.
	$\psi$ is a canonical homomorphism with trivial kernel. Thus, $\psi$ is one-to-one.\\


	Let $a,b \in F$.
	And suppose $\psi(a) = \psi(b)$.
	It is enough to prove that $a = b$.
	By the definition of $\psi$, we have $a+\generator{p(x)} = b + \generator{p(x)} \implies a-b \in \generator{p(x)}$.
	Suppose $a \ne b$.
	Then $a-b \ne 0$ and $degree(a-b) = 0$.
	Then, $\generator{p(x)} = F[x]$ which is a contradiction since $\generator{p(x)}$ is maximal ideal.
	Therefore, $\psi$ is one-to-one.\\

	
	We have $p(x)$ is a factor of $f(x)$.
	Thus $p(\alpha) = 0 \implies f(\alpha) = 0$.
	Thus, it remains to prove that there exists $\alpha \in F[x]/\generator{p(x)}$ such that $p(\alpha) = 0$.\\

	Let $p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2 x^2\cdots + a_n x^n$.
	Consider $\alpha = x + \generator{p(x)}$.
	Then $p(\alpha) = \phi_\alpha(p)$.
	Thus, $p(\alpha) = a_0 + a_1(x+\generator{p(x)}) + \cdots + a_n(x + \generator{p(x)})^n$.
	Thus, $p(\alpha) = (a_0+a_1x + a_n x^n) + \generator{p(x)} = p(x) + \generator{p(x)} = \generator{p(x)} = 0$.
	Therefore, $p(\alpha) = 0$ and $f(\alpha) = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{description}
	\item[algebraic over $F$] Let $F \le E$.
		An element $\alpha \in E$ is algebraic over a field $F$, if there exists $f(x) \in F[x]$ such that $f(\alpha) = 0$.
	\item[transcendental over $F$] Let $F \le E$.
		An element $\alpha \in E$ is transcendental over the field $F$, if it is not algebraic over $F$.
	\item[algebraic number] We have, $\mathbb{Q} \le \mathbb{C}$. A complex number $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ is algebraic if  it is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$.
		Example : $2,\sqrt{2},i$
	\item[transcendental number] A complex number $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ is transcendental if it is not an algebraic number.
		Example : $\pi,e$ (proof excluded)
\end{description}

\textbf{Note 1} : A polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ is reducible/irreducible depending upon the choice of the field $F$.
For example : $x^2-2$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, but is reducible over $\mathbb{R}$.

\textbf{Note 2} : An element $\alpha \in E$ is algebraic/transcendental depending on the choice of the field $F$.
For example : $\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{C}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ since $x^2-2 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$.

\begin{theorem}
	Let $E$ be an extension field of $F$, and $\alpha \in E$.
	Let function $\phi_\alpha : F[x] \to E$ be an evaluation homomoprhism.
	Then $\alpha$ is transcendental  if and only if $\phi_\alpha$ is one-to-one.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	An element $\alpha \in E$ is transcendental if and only if $f(\alpha) \ne 0$ for any nonzero $f(x) \in F[x]$ where $f(\alpha) = \phi_\alpha(f)$.
	Thus, kernel of $\phi_\alpha$ is trivial.
	That is, $\ker(\phi_\alpha) = \{ 0 \}$.
	Therefore, $\phi_\alpha$ is one-to-one.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $E$ be an extension field of $F$ and $\alpha \in E$ be algebraic over $F$.
	Then there exists a unique irreducible polynomial $p(x)$ with minimum degree in $F[x]$ and $p(\alpha) = 0$.
	If there exists a nonzero polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ with $f(\alpha) = 0$, then $p(x)$ divides $f(x)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Consider evaluation homomorphism $\phi_\alpha : F[x] \to E$ defined by $\phi_\alpha(f) = f(\alpha)$.
	Then $\ker(\phi)$ is an ideal in $F[x]$.
	Since every ideal in $F[x]$ is principal, there exists $p(x) \in F[x]$ such that $\generator{p(x)} = \ker(\phi)$.
	And $f(\alpha) = 0 \implies f \in \ker(\phi) = \generator{p(x)}$.
	Thus, $p(x)$ divides $f(x)$.\\

	Suppose $p(x) = r(x)s(x)$.
	Then $p(\alpha) = r(\alpha)s(\alpha) = 0$.
	However, $E$ is a field and has no zero divisors.
	Thus, there exists a polynomial of lesser degree in $\generator{p(x)}$ which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{description}
	\item[monic polynomial] A polynomial which has $1$ as the coefficient of highest power of $x$.
		For example : $x^3 - 3x \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$
	\item[$irr(\alpha,F)$] The unique monic, irreducible polynomial $p(x) \in F[x]$ such that $p(\alpha) = 0$.
		For example, $irr(\sqrt{3},\mathbb{Q}) = x^2-3$.
		And $\sqrt{3}$ is the \textbf{minimial} polynomial for $\sqrt{3}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$
	\item[$deg(\alpha,F)$] The degree of the unique monic, irreducible polynomial $p(x) \in F[x]$ such that $p(\alpha) = 0$.
		For example, $deg(\sqrt{3},\mathbb{Q}) = 2$.
	\item[simple extension] An extension field $E$ of field $F$ is a simple extension if $E = F(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha \in E$.
\end{description}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $E$ be a simple extension $F(\alpha)$ of field $F$ where $\alpha \in E$ is algebraic over $F$.
	Let $deg(\alpha,F) = n \ge 1$.
	Then any element $\beta \in E$ can be uniquely expressed in the form $\beta = b_0 + b_1\alpha + \cdots + b_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}$ where $b_k \in F$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Consider the evaluation homomorphism $\phi_\alpha : F[x] \to E$ defined by $\phi_\alpha(f) = f(\alpha)$.
	Then $\phi_\alpha[F[x]] = F(\alpha)$.\\
	
	Let $irr(\alpha,F) = p(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots +a_1x+a_0$.
	Then, $p(\alpha) = 0$.
	Thus, 
\begin{equation}
	\alpha^n = -a_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}-a_{n-2} \alpha^{n-2} - \cdots - a_1\alpha - a_0
\end{equation}
	Clearly, any higher power of $\alpha$ can be eliminated from $f(\alpha)$ as shown below,
	\begin{align*}
		\alpha^{n+1} = & \alpha \alpha^n = -a_{n-1} \alpha^n -a_{n-2} \alpha^{n-1} - \cdots - a_1\alpha^2 - a_0 \alpha \\ 
		 = & a_{n-1} \left( a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}+a_{n-2}\alpha^{n-2}+\cdots+a_1\alpha + a_0 \right)\\
		& - a_{n-2}\alpha^{n-1} - a_{n-3}\alpha^{n-2} - a_1\alpha^2 - a_0 \alpha
	\end{align*}

	Thus, in the representation of the element in $F(\alpha)$, the maximum degree of $\alpha$ is $deg(\alpha,F)-1$.
	Therefore, $\beta \in F(\alpha) \implies \beta = b_0 + b_1\alpha + b_2\alpha^2 + \cdots + b_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}$.\\

	We can also show that this representation is unique for any $\beta \in F(\alpha)$.
	Suppose $\beta = b_0'+b_1'\alpha+b_2'\alpha^2+\cdots+b_{n-1}'\alpha^{n-1}$.
	Then $0 = (b_0 - b_0') + (b_1 - b_1')\alpha + \cdots + (b_{n-1} - b_{n-1}')\alpha^{n-1} = \phi_\alpha(g)$ where $g(x) = (b_0 - b_0') + (b_1 - b_1')x + \cdots + (b_{n-1} - b_{n-1}')x^{n-1}$.
	Clearly, degree of $g(x)$ is $deg(\alpha,F)-1$ which is less than the minimum degree for a non-zero irreducible polynomial for $\alpha$ over $F$.
	Thus $g(x) = 0$.
	In other words, $b_j = b_j',\ \forall j$ and representation for $\beta \in F(\alpha)$ is unique.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Exercises \S29}
\subsubsection{Irreducibility Conditions for Polynomials}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Irreducibility over a finite field\\
		$x^2+1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}_3$ since for every $x \in \{ 0,1,2 \},\ x^2+1 \ne 0$.
\item Irreducibility in rational field : Eisentein's Criteria (\S23.15) \\
	Consider $f(x) = x^3+60x^2+30x+12$ since for $p=3$, $f(x)$ satisfies Eisentein's Criteria.
		And thus is $f(x)$ irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.\\
	Note that for $p = 2,5,7,\dots$ the Eisentein's Criteria is not satisfied.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Algebraic over a Field}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ \cite[Exercise 29.2]{fraleigh}
	\begin{align*}
		\alpha = & \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \\
		\implies \alpha^2 = & 2 + 2\sqrt{6} + 3 =  5 + 2\sqrt{6}  \\
		\implies \alpha^2 - 5 =  & 2\sqrt{6} \\
		\implies  (\alpha^2-5)^2 = & 24 \\
		\implies \alpha^4 - 10\alpha^2 + 1 = & 0 \\
		\implies \phi_{\alpha}(x^4 - 10x^2 + 1) = & 0 
	\end{align*}
		We have, $irr(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3},\mathbb{Q}) = x^{\textcolor{blue}{4}}-10x^2+1$ and $deg(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3},\mathbb{Q}) = \textcolor{blue}{4}$.
	\item $\pi,e$ are transcendental numbers. (proof excluded)\\
		However, $\pi$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$ since $x-\pi \in \mathbb{Q}(\pi)[x]$.
		
	\item Consider $\alpha = \pi^2$ and $F = \mathbb{Q}(\pi^3)$. \cite[Exercise 29.16]{fraleigh}
	\begin{align*}
		\alpha^3 = & \pi^6 = (\pi^3)^2 \\
		\alpha^3-(\pi^3)^2 = & 0 \\
		\implies \phi_\alpha(x^3-(\pi^3)^2) = & 0 
	\end{align*}
	Thus, $irr(\pi^2,\mathbb{Q}(\pi^3)) = x^{\textcolor{blue}{3}}-(\pi^3)^2$ and $deg(\pi^2,\mathbb{Q}(\pi^3)) = \textcolor{blue}{3}$.\\ 
		Note that $x^3-(\pi^3)^2 \in \textcolor{blue}{\mathbb{Q}(\pi^3)[x]}$ since $\pi^3 \in \mathbb{Q}(\pi^3) \implies -(\pi^3)^2 \in \mathbb{Q}(\pi^3)$.
		However, $x^3-(\pi^3)^2 \notin \textcolor{blue}{\mathbb{Q}[x]}$.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Factorisation over Extended Field}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Factorisation over Finite Extension of Finite Field \cite[Exercise 29.25]{fraleigh}\\
		Let $\alpha$ be a zero of $f(x) = x^3+x^2+1 \in \mathbb{Z}_2[x]$.
		Clearly, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_2$.
		And $x-\alpha$ is a factor of $f(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_2(\alpha)$. We have, $f(x) = (x-a)g(x)$

		\[\text{By long division, } g(x) = \frac{x^3+x^2+1}{x-\alpha} = x^2+(1+\alpha)x+(\alpha+\alpha^2)\]
		Therefore, $x^3+x^2+1 = (x-\alpha)[x^2+(1+\alpha)x+\alpha(1+\alpha)]$.\\

		The elements of $\mathbb{Z}_2(\alpha)$ are of the form $a_0+a_1\alpha+a_2\alpha^2$ where $a_0,a_1,a_2 \in \{0,1\}$.
		Also we have, $\alpha$ is a zero of $x^3+x^2+1$.
		Thus, $\alpha^3 = \alpha^2+1$.\\

		In order to find a zero of $g(x)$ it is sufficient to evaluate $g(x)$ for all the eight elements $ 0, 1, \alpha, (1+\alpha), \alpha^2, (1+\alpha^2),(\alpha+\alpha^2), (1+\alpha+\alpha^2) \in \mathbb{Z}_2(\alpha)$.
		
		Clearly, $g(1) = \alpha^2+2\alpha+2 = \alpha^2$.
		And $g(\alpha) = \alpha^2 + 2\alpha(1+\alpha) = \alpha^2$.
		However, $g(\alpha^2) = \alpha^4+\alpha^3+2\alpha^2+\alpha = \alpha(\alpha^2+1)+(\alpha^2+1) + 0\alpha^2 + \alpha = \alpha^3 + \alpha^2 + 2\alpha + 1 = \alpha^3+\alpha^2+1 = 0$.
		Thus, $\alpha^2$ is a zero of $g(x)$ and $g(x) = (x-\alpha^2)h(x)$.
		\[\text{By long division, } h(x) = \frac{x^2+(1+\alpha)x+(\alpha+\alpha^2)}{x-\alpha^2} = x+(1+\alpha+\alpha^2)\]
		Therefore, we have the following linear factoriation for $f(x)$,\\ $f(x) = (x-\alpha)(x-\alpha^2)(x-1-\alpha-\alpha^2) = (x+\alpha)(x+\alpha^2)(x+1+\alpha+\alpha^2)$ since $-\alpha = 0-\alpha = 2\alpha-\alpha = \alpha$ in $\mathbb{Z}_2$.\\

	Note : Students should be able to perform long division of polynomials over extended fields.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Algebraic Extensions \S31}
\begin{description}
	\item[$(G : H)$] is the number of $H$-left cosets in $G$.
	\item[algebraic extension] A extension field $E$ of a field $F$ is algebraic if every element in $E$ is algebraic over $F$.\\
		For example, $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{R}$.
		But, $\mathbb{R}$ is not algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$.
	\item[finite extension] A extension field $E$ of field $F$ is a finite extension if $E$ is a finite dimensional vector space over $F$.
		And $[E:F]$ is the \textbf{dimension of the vector space} $E$ over $F$.
		Again, $[E:F]$ is the \textbf{degree of the finite extension} $E$ over $F$.\\
		For example, $\mathbb{C}$ is a finite extension of degree $2$ over $\mathbb{R}$, $[\mathbb{C} : \mathbb{R}] = 2$. But, $\mathbb{R}$ is not a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $[\mathbb{R} : \mathbb{Q}]$ is infinite.
\end{description}

\begin{theorem}
	Every finite field extensions is an algebraic extension.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $E$ be a fintie extension of degree $n$ over $F$.
	Then $[E:F] = n$.
	Suppose $\alpha \in E$.
	Clearly, $\{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\cdots,\alpha^n \}$ is set of $n+1$ vectors from the vector space $E$ over $F$.
	We know that in a vector space of dimension $n$, any set having $n+1$ vector is linearly dependant.
	In other words, there exits scalars $c_0,c_1,\cdots,c_n \in F$ (not all zero) such that $c_0+c_1\alpha+c_2\alpha^2+\cdots+c_n\alpha^n = 0$.\\

	Clearly, $f(x) = c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + \cdots +c_nx^n$ is a polynomial in $F[x]$ such that $\phi_\alpha(f) = f(\alpha) = 0$.
	Since $\alpha \in E$ is arbitrary, every element in $E$ is algebraic over $F$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	If $E$ is a finite extension of $F$ and $K$ is a finite extension of $E$.
	Then $K$ is a finite extension of $F$.
	And $[K:F] = [K:E][E:F]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $[E:F] = n$ and $[K:E] = m$.
	Let $\{ \alpha_1,\alpha_2,\cdots,\alpha_n \}$ be basis for vector space $E(F)$ and let $\{ \beta_1,\beta_2,\cdots,\beta_m\}$ be basis for vector space $K(E)$.
	We claim that $\{\alpha_i\beta_j : 1 \le i \le n,\ 1 \le j \le m \}$ is a basis for the vector space $K(F)$.\\

	Let $\gamma \in K$.
	Then we have $b_1,b_2,\cdots,b_m \in E$ such that $\gamma = b_1\beta_1+b_2\beta_2+\cdots+b_m\beta_m$.
	Again, for each $b_j \in E$, we have $a_{ij} \in F$ such that $b_j = a_{1j}\alpha_1+a_{2j}\alpha_2+\cdots+a_{nj}\alpha_n$.
	Therefore, 
	\[\gamma = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij} \alpha_i \beta_j\]

	That is, $\{ \alpha_i \beta_j : i =1,2,\cdots,n,\ j=1,2,\cdots,m \}$ spans $K$.
	It remains to prove that $\{\alpha_i \beta_j \}$ is linearly independent.
	Suppose it is linearly dependent.
	Then there exists scalars $c_{i,j} \in F$ (not all zero) such that
	\[\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m c_{i,j} \alpha_i \beta_j  = \sum_{j=1}^m \left( \sum_{i=1}^n c_{i,j} \alpha_i \right) \beta_j  = 0\]
	
	Let $\sum_{i=1}^n c_{i,j}\alpha_i = b_j$.
	We know that, $\{ \beta_j : j = 1,2,\cdots,m \}$ is linearly independent.
	Thus, $\sum_j b_j \beta_j = 0 \implies b_j = 0,\ \forall j$.\\
	

	Again $b_j = 0 \implies \sum_{i = 0}^n c_{i,j}\alpha_i = 0$.
	Once again, $\{ \alpha_i : i = 1,2,\cdots,n \}$ is linear independent.
	Thus, $c_{i,j} = 0,\ \forall i,j$.
	Thus, $\{ \alpha_i \beta_j \}$ is linearly independent.
	Therefore, $\{ \alpha_i \beta_j \}$ is a basis for the vector space $K(F)$.
	And $[K : F] = |\{\alpha_i \beta_j : i =1,2,\cdots,n \text{ and } j=1,2,\cdots,m\}|= mn$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	Let $F_i$ be fields and $F_{i+1}$ are finite extensions of $F_i$s for $i = 1,2,\cdots,r$.
	Then $[F_r : F_1] = [F_r : F_{r-1}][F_{r-1}:F_{r-2}]\cdots[F_2:F_1]$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	We have, $F_3$ is a finite extension of $F_1$ and 
	\begin{equation}
		[F_3:F_1] = [F_3:F_2][F_2:F_1]
	\end{equation}
	Suppose $F_k$ is a finite extension of $F_1$ and 
	\begin{equation}
		[F_k : F_1] = [F_k:F_{k-1}][F_{k-1}:F_{k-2}] \cdots [F_2:F_1]
	\end{equation}
	\begin{align*}
		[F_{k+1}:F_1] = & [F_{k+1} : F_k][F_k : F_1] \text{ since } F_k \text{ is a finite extension of } F_1\\
		= & [F_{k+1}:F_k][F_k:F_{k-1}][F_{k-1}:F_{k-2}] \cdots [F_2:F_1]
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	If $E$ is an extension field of $F$ and $\alpha \in E$ is algebraic over $F$ and $\beta \in F(\alpha)$, then $deg(\beta,F)$ divides $deg(\alpha,F)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	We have, $\deg(\alpha,F) = [F(\alpha) : F]$ and $\deg(\beta,F) = [F(\beta):F]$.
	Also given that $\beta \in F(\alpha) \implies F(\beta) \le F(\alpha)$.
	Clearly, $F \le F(\beta) \le F(\alpha)$.
	Therefore, $[F(\alpha) : F] = [F(\alpha):F(\beta)][F(\beta):F]$.
	And $[F(\alpha):F(\beta)] = [F(\alpha):F]/[F(\beta):F]$.
	Clearly, $[F(\beta):F]$ divides $[F(\alpha):F]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[algebraic closure]
	Let $E$ be an extension field of $F$.
	Then $\bar{F}_E = \{ \alpha \in E : \alpha \text{ is algebraic over } E \}$ is a subfield of $E$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\alpha,\beta \in \bar{F}_E$.
	Then $\alpha,\beta \in E$ are algebraic over $F$.
	And $F(\alpha,\beta)$ is a finite extension field of $F$.
	Thus every element in $F(\alpha,\beta)$ are algebraic over $F$.
	Thus, $\alpha+\beta, \alpha\beta,\alpha-\beta,\alpha/\beta \in \bar{F}_E$.
	Therefore, $\bar{F}_E$ is a subfield of $E$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	The set of all algebraic numbers forms a field.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\alpha$ be an algebraic number.
	Then $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\alpha$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$.
	Clearly, the set of all algebraic numbers, $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_\mathbb{C}$ is a subfield of $\mathbb{C}$.

	\item[algebraic closure] Let $F$ be a field and $E$ be an extension field of $F$.
		Then the (smallest) field containing all elements of $E$ which are algebraic over $F$ is the algebraic closure $\bar{F}_E$ of $F$ in $E$.
	\item[algebraically closed] Let $F$ be a field.
		$F$ is algebraically closed if every non-constant polynomial in $F[x]$ has a zero in $F[x]$.
		
\end{description}

\textbf{Note : } Let $F$ be algebraically closed.
Then every irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ are linear since every non-constant polynomial has a linear factor.

\begin{theorem}
	A field $F$ is algebraically closed if and only if every non-constant polynomial $f(x)$ can be factorised in $F[x]$ into linear factors.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $F$ be algebraically closed and $f(x)$ be a non-constant polynomial in $F[x]$.
	Then $f(x)$ has a zero $\alpha \in F$.
	Then $x-\alpha$ is a factor of $f(x)$.
	That is, $f(x) = (x-\alpha)g(x)$.
	If $g(x) \in F[x]$ is non-constant, then it has a zero in $F$.
	Continuing like this, $f(x)$ can be factorised in $F[x]$ into linear factors.\\

	Suppose every non-constant polynomial in $F[x]$ can be factorised into linear factors.
	Let $f(x)$ be a non-constant polynomial in $F[x]$.
	Then $f(x)$ has a linear factor $(ax+b) \in F[x]$.
	Clearly, $-b/a$ is a zero of $f(x)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Algebraically closed field has no proper algebraic extensions.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $E$ be an algebraic extension field of $F$.
	Then if $\alpha \in E$, we have $irr(\alpha,F) = (x-\alpha)$ since $F$ is algebraically closed, every irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ are linear.
	Thus $\alpha \in F$.
	Since $\alpha \in E$ is arbitrary, $F = E$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]
	$\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f(z) \in \mathbb{C}[z]$.
	Suppose $f(z)$ has no zeroes in $\mathbb{C}$.
	Then $1/f(z)$ is an entire function and as $|z| \to \infty$, $|f(z)| \to \infty$.
	Thus, $\lim_{|z|\to\infty} \frac{1}{|f(z)|} = 0$.
	And $1/f(z)$ is bounded.\\
	
	By Liouville's theorem, every bounded entire function is constant.
	Therefore, $1/f(z)$ is constant and $f(z)$ is also constant.
	Thus, every non-constant polynomial function in $\mathbb{C}[z]$ has a zero in $\mathbb{C}$.
\end{proof}

	\item[POSET] Partial Ordered Set - A set together with partial order (reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive relation).\\
		

	For example $(\mathbb{R},<)$, the set of all real numbers together with less than relation is a poset.
		However, in a poset it is not necessary that two arbitrary elements are comparable.
		$(\mathbb{C},R)$ defined by $aRb$ if $\Re(a) = \Re(b)$ and $Im(a) < Im(b)$ is a poset in which $2+3i$ and $3+3i$ are not comparable.
	\item[chain] A subset of a poset in which any two elements are comparable.
		That is, $x,y \in T \implies x < y \text{ OR } y < x$.\\

	For example, For above defined poset $(\mathbb{C},R)$, $T = \{ 2+ib \in \mathbb{C} : b \in \mathbb{R} \}$ is a chain in $\mathbb{C}$.
\end{description}
\begin{lemma}[Zorn]
	If every chain in a poset $S$ has an upper bound.
	Then $S$ has at least one maximal element in it.
\end{lemma}

	Not required ( I think, there is no proof.
	We just take it as an axiom - always true !.
	If it is not true for a collection then it is not a set !! )

\subsection{Basic Constructions}
\subsubsection{Finding Midpoint of a line}
	Let $OA$ be a line.
	The line passing through the intersection of circles with center $O$ and $A$ with diameter greater than the length of the line gives a perpendicular line through its mid point (say, perpendicular bisection).

\subsubsection{Drawing Perpendicular line through a point}
	Let $OA$ be a line and $B$ be a point on that line.
	Find points $P,Q$ on $OA$ which are equidistant from $B$.
	Then the perpendicular bisection of $PQ$ is a line perpendicular to $OA$ through $B$.
\subsubsection{Drawing Parallel Line}

\begin{proof}
\begin{description}

		And draw the line $AB$ of length $|\beta|$ on that extended line, at an end point $A$ of former line, but in the opposite direction of extension( towards $O$).

\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	The set of all constructible real numbers forms a subfield of the field of real numbers.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	The set of all constructible real numbers say $H$, contains both $0$ and $1$.
	since the line of length zero is trivial and line of unit length is provided.
	And we have, $\forall \alpha,\beta \in H,\ \alpha+\beta,\alpha-\beta,\alpha\beta,\alpha/\beta \in H$.
	Since $\alpha - \beta \in H$, $0-\beta = -\beta$ which is the additive inverse of $\beta$.
	And $1/\beta = \beta^{-1}$ is the multiplicative inverse of $\beta$.
	Thus, the set of all constructible numbers is a subfield of $\mathbb{R}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	The field of $F$ of constructible numbers consists {\color{blue}precisely} of all real numbers that we can obtain from $\mathbb{Q}$ by taking square root of positive numbers a finite number of times and applying a finite number of field operations.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	The constructible numbers are closed under field operations and forms a subfield $H$ of real numbers.
	We have, $\mathbb{Q}$ is the prime field of $\mathbb{R}$.
	That is, every subfield of $\mathbb{R}$ contains $\mathbb{Q}$.
	Thus, the subfield $H$ of constructible numbers contains $\mathbb{Q}$.
	That is, all the rational numbers are constructible.
	Therefore, it remains to prove that if $\alpha > 0$ is constructible then $\sqrt{\alpha}$ is also constructible.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw[blue] (0,0) -- (4,0);
	\draw (0,0) -- (-1,0);
	\draw[red] (0,0) -- (0,2);

	\draw (4,0) -- (0,2);
	\draw (-1,0) -- (0,2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

	Let $OA$ and $OP$ be colinear lines such that $OA$ be a line of length $\| \alpha \|$ and $OP$ be a line of unit length.
	Find the mid point of $PA$ and draw a circle of diameter $PA$.
	Then the length of the perpendicular $OQ$ from $PA$ to the circle is of length $\| \sqrt{\alpha} \|$ since $\Delta OAQ$ and $\Delta OQP$ are similar triangles.\\


	Therefore, real numbers obtained from rational numbers through finite number of additions/subtractions, multplications/divisions, and square root are constructible.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Note : } For example $\sqrt[4]{5\sqrt[8]{3}-2}$ is constructible, but $\sqrt[6]{2}$ and $\pi$ are not constructible.
We skip the proof that a real number which can't be obtained from rationals by a finite number of these operations is not constructible.
And assume that these three operations define the entire field of constructible numbers.

\begin{corollary}
	Let $\gamma$ be constructible number which is not rational.
	Then there exists a sequence of real numbers $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_n = \gamma$ such that for every $i = 2,\dots,n$, the extension field $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_i)$ is an extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_{i-1})$ of degree two.\\


	In other words, for any constructible number $\gamma$, $[\mathbb{Q}(\gamma) : \mathbb{Q}] = 2^n$ for some positive integer $n$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\gamma$ be a constructible number which can be obtained from rationals by $n$ square root operations and a finite number of field operations.
	Then, we have a sequence of constructible numbers $\alpha_1, \alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n$ such that $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_i) : \mathbb{Q}(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_{i-1})] = 2$.
	Therefore, $[\mathbb{Q}(\gamma) : \mathbb{Q}] = 2^n$.
\end{proof}

	For example, $\gamma = \sqrt[4]{5\sqrt[8]{3}-2}$.
	Then $\alpha_1 = \sqrt{3}$, $\alpha_2 = \sqrt[4]{3}$, $\alpha_3= \sqrt[8]{3}$, $\alpha_4 = \sqrt{5\sqrt[8]{3}-2}$ and $\alpha_5 = \gamma$.
	Clearly, the geometric construction of $\gamma$ contains five instances of square root operation.

\subsection{Impossible Problems from Ancient Times}
\subsubsection{Doubling the cube}
\begin{theorem}
	There exists a cube such that it is impossible to construct the side of the cube with double the volume.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose the cube is of unit side.
	Then the side of the cube with double the volume is $\gamma = \sqrt[3]{2}$.
	And $irr(\gamma,\mathbb{Q}) = x^3-2$ and $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}:\mathbb{Q}] = 3 \ne 2^n$.
	Therefore, $\gamma$ is not constructible.
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Squaring the circle}
\begin{theorem}
	There exists a circle such that it is impossible to construct the side of the square with the same area.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose the circle of is of unit radius.
	Then area of the circle is $2\pi$.
	And the side of the square with same area is $\sqrt{2\pi}$.
	Since $\pi$ is transcendental, $\pi$,$\sqrt{\pi}$ and $\sqrt{2\pi}$ are not constructible.
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Trisecting an angle}
\begin{theorem}
	There exists an angle which can be trisected.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We have $\cos 3\theta = 4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta$.
	Consider $\theta = 20^\circ$.
	Then $\gamma = \cos \theta$ is a root of the irreducible polynomial $4x^3-3x-0.5$.
	That is, $\gamma$ is a root of the monic irreducible polynomial $x^3-\frac{3}{4}x-\frac{1}{8}$ of degree $3$.
	Thus, $\gamma$ is not constructible, since $[\mathbb{Q}(\gamma) : \mathbb{Q}] = 3 \ne 2^n$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Structure of a Finite Field}
\begin{theorem}
	Let $E$ be a finite extension of degree $n$ over a finite field $F$.
	If $F$ has $q$ elements, then $E$ has $q^n$ elements.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We have, extension field $E$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over the field $F$.
	Let $\{ \alpha_1, \alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n \}$ be a basis of the vector space $E$ over $F$.
	Then every elements of $E$ can be uniquely written as linear combination of basis vectors.
\begin{equation*}
 	\forall \beta \in E,\ \beta = b_1 \alpha_1 + b_2 \alpha_2 + \dots + b_n \alpha_n
\end{equation*}
	Suppose $\beta \in E$ has two distinct linear combinations.
	Then, the vectors $\{ \alpha_1, \alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_n\}$ are not linearly independent, which is a contraditciton.\\
	
	Since the representation is unique and $F$ has $q$ elements, there are $q^n$ distinct linear combinations possible.
	Therefore, $E$ has $q^n$ elements.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	If $E$ is a finite field of characteristic $p$.
	Then $F$ contains exactly $p^n$ elements for some integer $n$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	We have, $E$ is a finite field of characteristic $p$.
	Thus, $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is the prime subfield of $E$.
	And $E$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
	Thus, $E$ is a finite dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
	Let $n$ be the dimension of $E$ over $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
	And $\mathbb{Z}_p$ has $p$ elements.
	Therefore, $E$ has $p^n$ elements.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $E$ be a field of $p^n$ elements contained in the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_p}$ of $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
	Then the elements of $E$ are precisely the zeroes of the polynomial $x^{p^n}-x \in \mathbb{Z}_p[x]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We have $E^\ast$ is a multiplicative group of non-zero elements in $E$.
	And $E^\ast$ has $p^n-1$ elements.
	Thus, order of any element $\alpha \in E^\ast$ should divide $p^n-1$.
	In other words, if $\alpha \in E^\ast$, then $\alpha^{p^n-1} = 1$.
	Clearly, $\alpha^{p^n} - \alpha = 0$, $\forall \alpha \in E$.
	However, $x^{p^n}$ can have atmost $p^n$ zeroes in $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_p}$.
	Thus, $E$ is precisely the set of all zeroes of $x^{p^n}-x \in \overline{\mathbb{Z}_p}$.
\end{proof}

%\begin{enumerate}[label=Note \arabic*]
%	\item The algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ contains zeroes of every polynomial of the form $x^{p^n}-x$ where $p$ is a prime and $n$ is an integer. Thus, algebraic closures are infinite fields. Remember : $\mathfrak{R}1$
%	\item $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_2}$ has two distinct square roots of unity. And the complex field contains only one of them !

\begin{corollary}
	Finite extension of finite fields are simple extensions.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Let $E$ be a finite extension field of the finite field $F$.
	Then the multiplicative group of non-zero elements $E^\ast$ is cyclic.
	Let $\alpha$ be a generator of the cyclic group $E^\ast$.
	Then, $E = F(\alpha)$.

\subsection{Galois Field $GF(p^n)$}
\begin{lemma}
	If $F$ is a field of prime characteristic $p$ with algebraic closure $\overline{F}$, then $x^{p^n}-x$ has $p^n$ distinct zeroes in $\overline{F}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We have, $\overline{F}$ is algebraically closed.
	And $x^{p^n}-x \in \overline{F}[x]$.
	Thus, $x^{p^n}-x$ can be factorised into $p^n$ linear components.
	It remains to prove that these factors are distinct.\\

	Clearly, $0$ is a zero of multiplicity $1$, since $x^{p^n}-x = x (x^{p^n-1}-1)$.
	Let $\alpha \ne 0$ be a zero of $x^{p^n}-x$.
	Then $\alpha$ is a zero of $x^{p^n-1}-1$.
	ie, $\alpha^{p^n-1}  = 1$.
	\begin{align*}
		(x-\alpha)g(x) = & x^{p^n-1}-1 \\
		g(x) = & \frac{x^{p^n-1}-1}{x-\alpha}
		\intertext{By long division, we get}
		g(x) = & x^{p^n-2} + \alpha x^{p^n-3} + \alpha^2 x^{p^n-4} + \dots + \alpha^{p^n-3} x + \alpha^{p^n-2} \\
		g(\alpha) = & (p^n-1)\alpha^{p^n-2} \\
		= &(p^n-1)\frac{\alpha^{p^n-1}}{\alpha} \\
		= & p^n \frac{1}{\alpha} - \frac{1}{\alpha}\\
		= & -\frac{1}{\alpha} \ne 0
	\end{align*}
	Thus, every zero of $x^{p^n-1}-x$ is of multiplicity $1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	If $F$ is a field of prime characteristic $p$, then $(\alpha+\beta)^{p^n} = \alpha^{p^n} + \beta^{p^n}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Since $F$ is a field of characteristic $p$, for every $\alpha \in F$, $p\alpha = 0$.
	\begin{align*}
		\intertext{ For $n=1$, we have }
		(\alpha+\beta)^p = & \alpha^p + p \alpha^{p-1}\beta+ \frac{p(p-1)}{2} \alpha^{p-2} \beta + \dots + p \alpha \beta^{p-1} + \beta^p \\
		= &  \alpha^p + 0 \alpha^{p-1}\beta+ 0 \alpha^{p-2} \beta + \dots + 0 \alpha \beta^{p-1} + \beta^p \\
		= & \alpha^p + \beta^p
	\end{align*}
	\begin{align*}
		\intertext{Suppose $(\alpha+\beta)^{p^{n-1}} = \alpha^{p^{n-1}} + \beta^{p^{n-1}}$, then} 
		(\alpha+\beta)^{p^n} = & \left[ (\alpha+\beta)^{p^{n-1}} \right]^p \\
		= & \left[ \alpha^{p^{n-1}} + \beta^{p^{n-1}} \right]^p \\
		= & \alpha^{p^n} + \beta^{p^n}
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, by mathematical induction the result is true.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Existence of Galois Field]
	For every prime power $p^n$, a finite field of $p^n$ elements exists.
\end{theorem}
{\color{blue} Hint : $\alpha^{p^n} = \alpha \iff \alpha^{p^n} - \alpha = 0 \iff \alpha$ is a zero of $x^{p^n} - x$}
\begin{proof}
	Consider the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_p}$ of $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
	Let $K$ be a subset of $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_p}$ containing all zeroes of $x^{p^n}-x \in \overline{\mathbb{Z}_p}$.\\
	
	Let $\alpha, \beta \in K$.
	Then $\alpha^{p^n} = \alpha$ and $\beta^{p^n} = \beta$.
	Since $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_p}$ is a field of characteristic $p$, we have ${\color{blue}(\alpha+\beta)^{p^n} = \alpha^{p^n}+ \beta^{p^n}} = \alpha + \beta$.
	Thus, $(\alpha+\beta)$ is a zero of $x^{p^n}-x$.
	ie, $(\alpha + \beta) \in K$.
	Clearly, $(\alpha\beta)^{p^n} = \alpha^{p^n} \beta^{p^n} = \alpha\beta$.
	Thus, $\alpha\beta \in K$.\\


	Again $(-\alpha)^{p^n} = (-1 \cdot \alpha)^{p^n} = (-1)^{p^n} \cdot \alpha^{p^n} = -1 \cdot \alpha = -\alpha$.
	Thus, $-\alpha \in K$.
	Also $(\alpha^{-1})^{p^n} = \left( \frac{1}{\alpha} \right)^{p^n} = \frac{1}{\alpha^{p^n}} = \frac{1}{\alpha} = \alpha^{-1}$.
	Thus, $\alpha^{-1} \in K$.\\
	

	Trivially, $0,1 \in K$.
	Therefore, $K$ is a subfield of $\overline{\mathbb{Z}_p}$ with $p^n$ elements since {\color{blue}the $p^n$ zeroes of $x^{p^n}-x$ are distinct}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	If $F$ is a finite field, then for every positive integer $n$, there exists an irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ of degree $n$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Let $F$ be a finite field.
	Then $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is prime field of $F$ for some prime $p$.
	And $F$ is of characteristic $p$ and has $p^r$ elements for some positive integer $r$.\\ %The number of elements of $F$ should be multiple of prime $p$ and shouldn't be a multiple of any other prime $q$.


	Let $K$ be the subfield of $\overline{F}$ containing precisely all the zeroes of the polynomial $x^{p^{rn}}-x \in \mathbb{Z}_p[x]$.
	Then, $K$ has a subfield isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p$ since $F$ is of characteristic $p$ and every subfield of $F$ has a subfield isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p$.\\

	By existence theorem of Galois Fields, every element of $F$ is a zero of the polynomial $x^{p^r}-x \in \mathbb{Z}_p[x]$.
	That is, $\alpha \in F \iff \alpha^{p^r} = \alpha$.
	\begin{align*}
		\alpha^{p^{rn}} & = \left[\alpha^{p^r}\right]^{p^{r(n-1)}} & =  \alpha^{p^{r(n-1)}} & \\
		& = \left[\alpha^{p^r}\right]^{p^{r(n-2)}} & =  \alpha^{p^{r(n-2)}} & \\
		& \vdots & \vdots & \\
		& = \left[\alpha^{p^r}\right]^{p^r} & = \alpha^{p^r} & = \quad \alpha
	\end{align*}
	Thus, $\alpha \in F \implies \alpha^{p^{rn}} = \alpha \implies \alpha \in K$.
	Therefore $F$ is a subfield of $K$.
	Clearly, $K$ is a finite extension of the finite field $F$.
	And the vector space $K$ over $F$ is $n$-dimensional, since $K$ has $p^{rn} = [p^r]^n$ elements and $F$ has $p^r$ elements.\\
	
	Since every finite extension of finite fields are simple extensions, we have $K = F(\beta)$ and $irr(\beta,F) = n$.
	That is, there exists an unique monic, irreducible polynomial $p(x) \in F[x]$ of degree $n$ such that $p(\beta) = 0$.
	Therefore, $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, there exists an irreducible polynomial in $F[x]$ of degree $n$.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}[Uniqueness of Galois Field]
	Let $p$ be a prime and $n$ a positive integer.
	If $E$ and $E'$ are fields of order $p^n$, then $E$ and $E'$ are isomorphic.\\

	There exists a unique finite field of order $p^n$, say \textbf{Galois Field}, $GF(p^n)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $E,E'$ be fields of order $p^n$.
	Then both fields have $\mathbb{Z}_p$ as prime field.
	Thus, $E$ is a simple extension of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of degree $n$.
	ie, $[E:\mathbb{Z}_p] = n$.
	And there exits an irreducible polynomial $f(x)$ such that $E \simeq \mathbb{Z}_p[x]/\generator{f(x)}$. \\


	Elements of $E$ are zeroes of $x^{p^n}-x$, thus $f(x)$ is a factor of $x^{p^n}-x$.
	Clearly, elements of $E'$ are zeroes of $x^{p^n}$ and therefore $E'$ has all zeroes of $f(x)$.
	And $E' \simeq \mathbb{Z}_p/\generator{f(x)}\simeq E$.
	Therefore, there exists a unique field of order $p^n$ (upto isomorphism), say $GF(p^n)$.
\end{proof}

%\subsection{Construction of UFD}
There are two important results on UFDs.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Every PID is a UFD.
	\item If $D$ is a UFD, then $D[x]$ is a UFD.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lemma}
	Let $R$ be a commutative ring and let $N_1 \subset N_2 \subset \dots $ be an ascending chain of ideals in $R$.
	Then $N = \cup_i N_i$ is an ideal of $R$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	\textbf{Step 1 : $N$ is a subring of $R$}\\
	Suppose $N_i,\ N_j$ are two ideals in the chain, $N_i \subset N_j$ and $a \in N_i$, $b \in N_j$.
	Clearly, $a \in N_j$.\\

	And $a \pm b,\ ab \in N_j$.
	And $0 \in N_j \implies 0 \in N$.
	We have, $0$ in every ideal\dag\footnote{
		Suppose $b \in N$.
		We have $-b \in R$ and $-b+b = 0 \in bN \subset N$.}.
	Take $a = 0$, we know that for every element $b \in N_j$, its additive inverse $-b \in N_j$.
	Thus $b \in N \implies b \in N_j \implies -b \in N_j \implies -b \in N$.
	Clearly, $N$ is a subring of $R$.\\
	
	\textbf{Step 2 : $N$ is a ideal of $R$}\\
	Let $a \in N$ and $r \in R$.
	We have, $a \in N \implies a \in N_J$ for some ideal $N_j$ in the chain.
	Since $N_j$ is an ideal $ar = ra \in N_j$.
	Therefore, $ar \in N$.
	And $N$ is a ideal of $R$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[\textbf{A}scending \textbf{C}hain \textbf{C}ondition]
	Let $D$ be a PID.
	If $N_1 \subset N_2 \subset \dots$ is an ascending chain of ideal, then there exists a positive integer $r$ such that $N_r = N_s$ for every $s \ge r$.\\

	In other words, every strictly\dag\footnote{
		Strictly ascending chain : $N_1 \subsetneq N_2 \subsetneq N_3 \subsetneq \dots \subsetneq N_k$.}
	ascending chain of ideals in a PID is of finite length.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $D$ be an integral domain.
	And $N_1 \subseteq N_2 \subseteq \dots$ be an ascending chain of ideals in $D$.
	Then $N = \cup_i N_i$ is an ideal in $D$.
	Since $D$ is a PID, by definition of \textbf{p}rincipal \textbf{i}deal \textbf{d}omain every ideal in it is a principal ideal.
	Thus, $N$ is a principal ideal in $D$.
	That is, there exists $c \in D$ such that $\generator{c} = N$.\\

	Since $c \in N$, and $N = \cup_i N_i$ we have $c \in N_r$ for some $r \in \mathbb{N}$.
	Then $\generator{c} = N_r = N$.
	Again, $N_r \subset N_s \implies c \in N_s \implies \generator{c} = N_s = N$.\\

	Suppose the chain of ideals are strictly ascending, that is every ideal in the chain is properly containing the former ideal.
	Then, the ideal $N_r$ such that $c \in N_r$ is the last ideal in its chain.
	Thus, striclty ascending chain of ideals is finite.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $D$ be a PID.
	Every element that is neither $0$ nor a unit in $D$ is a product of irreducibles.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $D$ is a PID.
	And suppose $a \in D$ is a neither a zero nor a unit.
	If $a$ is an irreducible, then the result is trivial.
	Suppose $a$ is not an irreducible.\\

	\textbf{Step 1 : $a$ has an irreducible factor}\\
	By the definition of irreducibility, $a$ has a factorisation $a = a_1b_1$ where $a_1,b_1$ are non-units.
	And every element $ar \in \generator{a}$ can be expressed as $ar = a_1b_1r = a_1r' \in \\generator{a_1}$.
	Thus, the ideal generated by $a$, $\generator{a}$ is contained in the ideal generated by $a_1$, $\generator{a_1}$.
	That is, $\generator{a} \subset \\generator{a_1}$.\\

	If $a_1$ is an irreducible, then the proof is complete.
	Suppose $a_1$ is not an irreducible.
	That is, $a_1 = a_2b_2$.
	Then $\generator{a_1} \subset \generator{a_2}$.
	Also we have, $\generator{a_1} \ne \generator{a_2}$.\\

	Suppose $\forall d \in D,\ a_2d \in \generator{a_1} \implies a_2\cdot 1 = a_2 \in \generator{a_1} \implies a_2 = a_1c_2 \implies a_1 = (a_1c_2)b_2 \implies c_2b_2 = 1 \implies b_2$ has multiplicative inverse $c_2$. This contradicts the assumption that $b_2$ is a unit.\\

	Continuing like this, we get a {\color{red}strictly} ascending chain of ideals $\generator{a} \subsetneq \generator{a_1} \subsetneq \generator{a_2}, \dots $.
	And we know that, every strictly ascending chain of ideals is finite.
	Thus, $a_r$ is an irreducible.
	And $a = a_1b_1 = (a_2b_2)b_1 = \dots = a_r(b_rb_{r-1}\dots b_1) = a_rb$.
	Clearly, $a$ has an irreducible factor $a_r$.\\

	\textbf{Step 2 : $a$ is a product of irreducibles}\\
	Suppose $a$ is neither zero nor a unit.
	Then $a = p_1c_1$ where $p_1$ is an irreducible and $c_1$ is not a unit.
	Continuing like this, we get another striclty ascending chain of ideals $\generator{a} \subsetneq \generator{c_1} \subsetneq \generator{c_2} \subsetneq \dots$ such that $a = p_1c_1 = p_1(p_2c_2) = \dots$ where $p_1,p_2,\dots$ are irreducibles and $c_j$ are non-units.
	Again, by ascending chain condition this strictly ascending chain is finite.
	That is, $a = p_1p_2\dots p_kc_k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
	Since $\generator{c_k}$ is a maximal ideal in $D$, $c_k$ is an irreducible say, $p_{k+1}$.
	Thus, any element $a \in D$ (except zero and units) can be expressed as product of irreducibles.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Irreducible element and Maximal Ideal}
We have seen earlier that a non-trivial principal ideal $\generator{p(x)}$ in $F[x]$ is maximal if and only if the generator $p(x)$ is irreducible over $F$.
Now we have a generalisation, which says ideals in PIDs are maximal if and only if the generator is irreducible.
Remember that for any field $F$, $F[x]$ is a PID.
\begin{lemma}
	An ideal $\generator{p}$ in a PID is maximal if and only if $p$ is an irreducible.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	\textbf{Part A : $\generator{p}$ maximal in $D \implies p$ irreducible in $D$}\\
	Let $D$ be a PID.
	Suppose $\generator{p}$ is a maximal ideal in $D$.
	Suppose $p = ab$ in $D$.
	That is, $p = ab$ where $a,b \in D$.
	Then, $\generator{p} \subset \generator{a}$.\\

	Suppose $\generator{p} = \generator{a}$.
	Then $a = pc = (ab)c \implies bc = 1$ and $b$ is a unit.\\

	Suppose $\generator{p} \ne \generator{a}$.
	Then $\generator{a} = D$, since $\generator{p}$ is a maximal ideal.
	That is $\generator{a} = \generator{1} \implies a,1$ are associates.
	And $a$ is a unit.\\

	Thus for any factorisation $p = ab$, either $a$ or $b$ is a unit.
	Therefore, $p$ is an irreducible.\\

	\textbf{Part B : $p$ is irreducible in $D \implies \generator{p}$ is maximal in $D$}\\
	Suppose $p$ is an irreducible in $D$.
	Then $p = ab$ where $a,b \in D $ implies that either $a$ or $b$ is a unit.
	Since $p = ab$, $\generator{p} \subset \generator{a}$.
	We know that, if $a$ is a unit then $\generator{a} = \generator{1} = D$.\\

	Suppose $a$ is not a unit.
	Then $b$ is a unit.
	That is, there exists $u \in D$ such that $bu = 1$.
	Then $pu = abu= a$.
	Thus, $\generator{a} \subset \generator{p} \implies \generator{p} = \generator{a}$.\\

	Thus, for any factorisation $p = ab$, the ideals generated by $a,b$ are either $D$ or $\generator{p}$ itself.
	In other words, there doesn't exist a proper ideal containing $\generator{p}$.
	Therefore, $\generator{p}$ is a maximal ideal in $D$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Every PID is UFD}
	We have seen earlier that $F[x]$ has unique factorisation of all its elements.
	Now, we generalise that result into ``every PID has unique factorisation for all its elements''.

\begin{lemma}
	In a PID, if an irreducible $p$ divides $ab$, then either $p|a$ or $p|b$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $D$ be a PID.
	Suppose $p \in D$ is irreducible.
	Suppose $p | ab$.
	Then $ab \in \generator{p}$.
	And we have, $\generator{p}$ is a maximal ideal.
	However, every maximal ideal in $D$ is a prime ideal.
	Thus, $ab \in \generator{p} \implies a \in \generator{p} \text{ or } b \in \generator{p}$.
	In other words, $p | a$ or $p | b$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	If $p$ is an irreducible in a PID $D$ and $p$ divides $a_1a_2\dots a_n$ where $a_i \in D$, then $p|a_i$ for at least one $i$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	We know that, $p | a_1a_2 \implies p | a_1 \text{ or } p | a_2$.\\
	Suppose $p | a_1a_2\dots a_k \implies p| a_1 \text{ or } p | a_2 \dots \text{ or } p | a_k$.\\
	Suppose $p | a_1a_2\dots a_{k+1} \implies p | a_1a_2\dots a_k \text{ or } p | a_{k+1}$.\\
	$\implies p|a_1 \text{ or } p|a_2 \text{ or } \dots p|a_k \text{ or } p | a_{k+1}$.\\
	That is, if $p$ divides a finite product, then it divides at least one of them.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	A nonzero, nonunit element $p$ in an integral domain $D$ is a prime if $\forall a,b \in D,\ p|ab \implies p|a \text{ or } p|b$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	Every PID is a UFD.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $D$ be a PID.
	Let $a \in D$ is neither a zero nor a unit.
	Then $a$ has a factorisation into irreducibles $a= p_1p_2\dots p_r$. 
	Suppose $a$ has another factorisation $a = q_1q_2\dots q_s$.\\

	We have $p_1 | q_1q_2\dots q_s$.
	Thus, $p_1$ divides at least one of them, say $q_j$.
	Without loss of generality, we assume that $p_1 | q_1$ (rearranging the terms if necessary).\\

	Since $q_1$ is an irreducible, $q_1 = p_1u_1 \implies u_1$ is a unit.
	Thus, $p_1p_2 \dots p_r = p_1u_1q_2q_3\dots q_s$.
	That is, $p_2p_3 \dots p_r = u_1 q_2q_3\dots q_s$.\\

	Continuing like this we get, $p_r = u_1u_2\dots u_{r-1} p_ru_rq_{r+1}q_{r+s}\dots q_s$.
	Thus $u_1u_2\dots u_rq_{r+1}q_{r+2}\dots q_s$ is a unit.
	We have $s = r$, otherwise $1 = u_1u_2\dots q_{r+1}\dots$ is a contradiction.
	Therefore, any element $a \in D$ has a unique factorisation except for order,associates and units.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	The integral domain $\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	The ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$ are of the form $n\mathbb{Z}$ where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
	Thus every ideal in $\mathbb{Z}$ are pricipal ideals.
	Therefore, $\mathbb{Z}$ is a PID.
	We know that every PID is a UFD.
	Thus, $\mathbb{Z}$ is a \textbf{u}nique \textbf{f}actorisation \textbf{d}omain.
\end{proof}

\subsection{$D$ is UFD $\implies D[x]$ is UFD}
\begin{definition}[gcd]
	Let $D$ be a UFD and $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$ be nonzero elements in $D$.
	An element $d \in D$ is a \textbf{g}reatest \textbf{c}ommon \textbf{d}ivisor of $a_i$ if $d$ is a common divisor of all $a_i$s and also divides any common divisor of $a_i$s.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[primitive]
	Let $D$ be a UFD.
	A nonconstant polynomial $a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^n \in D[x]$ is a primitive if $1$ is the gcd of all $a_i$s.
\end{definition}
	For exmaple, $4x^3+3x^2+2 \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a primitive since $\gcd(4,3,2) = 1$.

\begin{lemma}
	If $D$ is a UFD, then for every nonconstant $f(x) \in D[x]$ we have $f(x) = cg(x)$ where $c \in D$ and $g(x) \in D[x]$ and $g(x)$ is primitive.
	The element $c \in D$ is unique upto a unit factor in $D$ and is the \textbf{content} of $f(x)$.
	Also $g(x)$ is unique upto a unit factor in $D$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	\textbf{Step 1 : There exists $c \in D$ such that $f(x) = cg(x)$}\\
	Let $f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \dots +a_nx^n$ be a non-constant polynomial in $D[x]$.
	Let $c = gcd(a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n)$.
	In other words, $c$ is the greatest common divisor of the coefficients of $f(x)$.
	Let $q_i = ca_i)$.
	Clearly, $gcd(q_1,q_2,\dots,q_n) = 1$.
	Thus, we have $f(x) = cg(x)$ where $g(x) = q_0+q_1x+\dots+q_nx^n)$ is a primitive.\\

	\textbf{Step 2 : There exists unique $c$ such that  $f(x) = cg(x)$}\\
	Suppose $f(x) = cg(x) = dh(x)$ where $c,d \in D$ and $g(x), h(x)$ are primitives.\\

	Clearly, $c$ and $d$ are associates.
	Otherwise, there exists an irreducible element $p$ such that $p | cg(x)$ but $p\!\not|\ dh(x)$ which is a contradiction.
	Thus, we can cancel all irreducible factors of $c$ to obtain, $ug(x) = vh(x)$ where $u$ and $v$ are units.
	Therefore, the content of $f(x)$, $c$ unique upto associates.\\

	Again, $f(x) = cg(x) = (cu) (u^{-1}g(x))$ and thus $g(x)$ is unique upto associates/units.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[content]
	Let $D$ be a UFD.
	Let $f(x) \in D[x]$.
	Then $f(x) = cg(x)$ for some primitive $g(x) \in D[x]$ and $c \in D$.
	The element $c$ which is unique upto units, is the content of $f(x)$.
\end{definition}
	For example, Let $f(x) = 8x^3+6x^2+4 \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$.
	Then $f(x) = 2(4x^3+3x^2+2)$ where $4x^3+3x^2+2 \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a primitive and $2 \in \mathbb{Z}$.
	Thus, $content(f) = 2$.

\begin{lemma}[Gauss]
	If $D$ is a UFD, then product of two primitive polynomials in $D[x]$ is again primitive.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_nx^n$ and $g(x) = b_0 + b_1x + \dots + b_mx^m$.
	Suppose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are primitives.
	Let $h(x) = f(x)g(x) = c_0 + c_1x + \dots + c_{n+m}x^{n+m}$.
	Let $p$ be an irreducible in $D$.
	Then $f(x)$ has a coefficient which is not divisible by $p$.
	Suppose $p$ divides every coefficient $f(x)$, then $f(x)$ is not a primitive.\\

	Let $r$ be the smallest integer such that $p\not\!|\ a_r$.
	Similarly, let $s$ be the smallest integer such that $p\not|\ b_s$.
	Now consider the coefficient $c_{r+s}$ of $h(x)$.
	\[ c_{r+s} = a_0b_{r+s}+\dots+a_{r-1}b_{s+1}+a_rb_s+a_{r+1}b_{s-1}+\dots+a_{r+s}b_0 \]
	By the selection of $r$, $p | a_j$ for every $j < r$.
	Thus, $p | a_0b_s+\dots+a_{r-1}b_{s+1}$.
	Similarly, by the selection of $s$, $p | b_k$ for every $k < s$.
	Thus, $p | a_{r+1}b_{s-1}+\dots+a_0b_s$.
	Clearly, $p | c_{r+s} \iff p | a_rb_s \implies p|a_r \text{ or } p|b_s$.
	This is not possible, thus $p \not| c_{r+s}$.	
	Thus, for any irreducible $p \in D$, $h(x)$ has a coefficient which is not divisible by $p$.
	Therefore, product of two primitives is always a primitive.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	If $D$ is a UFD, then a finite product of primitive polynomials in $D[x]$ is again primitive.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\{f_k\}_{k=1}^n$ be a family of primitives.
	Then $f_1(x)f_2(x)$ is a primitive, since product of two primitives is always a primitive.\\

	Suppose $g(x) = f_1(x)f_2(x)\dots f_k(x)$ is a primitive.\\

	Consider $h(x) = f_1(x)f_2(x)\dots f_{k+1}(x) = g(x)f_{k+1}(x)$.
	Since both $g(x)$ and $f_{k+1}(x)$ are primitives their product $h(x)$ is also a primitive.\\

	Thus by finite mathematical induction, every finite product of primitives is a primitive.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	Let $D$ be a UFD and let $F$ be a field of quotients of $D$.
	Let $f(x) \in D[x]$ where $\deg f(x) > 0$.
	If $f(x)$ is an irreducible in $D[x]$, then $f(x)$ is also an irreducible in $F[x]$.
	Also, if $f(x)$ is primitive in $D[x]$ and irreducible in $F[x]$, then $f(x)$ is irreducible in $D[x]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $D$ be a UFD and $F$ be the field of quotients of $D$.
	Then elements of $F$ are of the form $(a,b) \in D \times D$.
	Also $(a,b)+(c,d)  = (ad+bc,bd)$ and $(a,b)\cdot (c,d) = (ac,bd)$.
	And we say express $(a,b)$ as $a/b$.\\

	\textbf{Part 1 : irreducible in $D[x] \implies$ irreducible in $F[x]$}\\
	Let $f(x) \in D[x]$ be an irreducible in $D[x]$.
	Suppose $f(x)$ is not irreducible in $F[x]$.
	Then $f(x) = r(x)s(x)$ where $r(x),s(x) \in F[x]$.\\

	The coefficients of $r(x)$ are of the form $a/b$.
	By multiplying $r(x)$ with the product of all denominators, we can remove its denominators and obtain an associate $r_1(x) \in D[x]$.
	Similarly, we have $s(x) = vs_1(x)$ where $s_1(x) \in D[x]$.
	Thus, $f(x) = r(x)s(x) = ur_1(x)vs_1(x) = uv r_1(x)s_1(x)$.
	Therefore, $f(x) \in D[x]$ is not an irreducible, which is a contradiction.
	Thus, $f(x)$ is irreducible in the quotient field $F$ as well.\\

	\textbf{Part 2 : irreducible in $F[x] \implies$ irreducible in $D[x]$}\\
	Suppose $f(x) \in D[x]$ is irreducible in $F[x]$.	
	Clearly, $F$ contains a UFD isomorphic to $D$.
	Thus $D[x] \le F[x]$.
	Therefore, any polynomial irreducible in $F[x]$ is also irreducible in $D[x]$.
\end{proof}
	We just saw that if $F$ is the quotient field of a UFD $D$ and $f(x) \in D[x]$. The irreducibility of $f(x)$ in $F[x]$ is necessary and sufficient for the irreducibility of $f(x)$ in $D[x]$. Now we prove that the factorisation is also unique upto a morphism.

\begin{corollary}
	If $D$ is a UFD and $F$ is a field of quotients of $D$, then a nonconstant polynomial $f(x) \in D[x]$ factors into a product of two polynomials of lower degrees $r$ and $s$ in $F[x]$ if and only if it has a factorization into polynomials of the same degress $r$ and $s$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	We know that if $f(x) \in D[x]$ has a factorisation $f(x) = r(x)s(x)$ in $F[x]$.
	Then it has a factorisation in $D[x]$ as well, $f(x) = cr_1(x)s_1(x)$ where $r_1(x),s_1(x)$ are associates of $r(x), s(x)$ in $F[x]$.
	Clearly, the associates are always of the same degree.\\

	Trivially, any factorisation in $D[x]$ will also be a factorisation in $F[x]$.
	And the factors will have the same degree, unless $D[x]$ has an irreducible polymonial which is not irreducible in $F[x]$.
	This is not possible.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	If $D$ is a UFD, then $D[x]$ is a UFD.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f(x) \in D[x]$.
	Suppose $deg(f) > 0$.
	Otherwise, $f(x)$ is a constant and we have trival factorisation.\\
	
	Let $f(x) = g_1(x)g_2(x)\dots g_r(x)$ be a factorisation in $D[x]$ with maximum number of factors.	
	Then $f(x) = c_1h_1(x)c_2h_2(x)\dots c_rh_r(x)$ where $g_k(x) = c_kh_k(x)$ and $h_k(x)$ are primitives.
	And $h_k(x)$ are irreducibles.
	Otherwise, $f(x)$ has a factorisation with greater number of factors than $r$ which is a contradiction.
	Thus, $f(x) = uh_1(x)h_2(x)\dots h_r(x)$ is a factorisation of $f(x)$ into a product of irreducibles.\\

	Suppose $f(x)$ has another factorisation $f(x) = G_1(x)G_2(x)\dots G_r(x)$.
	Then $f(x) = vH_1(x)H_2(x)\dots H_r(x)$ with $H_k(x)$ are all irreducibles.
	We know that, $h_k(x) | f(x) \implies h_k(x) | H_1(x)H_2(x)\dots H_r(x) \implies h_k(x) | H_k(x)$ (WLOG).
	Therefore, the factorisation is unique.
\end{proof}

For example, let $x,y$ be two indeterminates, then an element $f(x) \in F[x,y]$ is of the form $\displaystyle\sum_{i,j = 0}^{n,m} a_{ij}x^i y^j$.

\begin{corollary}
	If $F$ is a field of quotients and $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ are indeterminates, then $F[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n]$ is a UFD.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $D$ is a UFD and $F$ is its field of quotients, then $F[x]$ is a UFD.\\

	Suppose $K = F[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k]$ is a UFD.\\

	Then, $F[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k,x_{k+1}] = F[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k][x_{k+1}] = K[x_{k+1}] = K[x]$ is a UFD.
\end{proof}

\section{Euclidean Domain \S46}
\begin{definition}[Euclidean Norm]
	Euclidean norm on an integral domain $D$ is a function $v$ which maps non-zero elements of $D$ into non-negative integers such that 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\forall a,b \in D, (b \ne 0)$ there exists $q,r \in D$ such that $a = qb + r$ where  either $r = 0$ or $v(r) < v(b)$ and 
		\item $\forall a,b \in D, (a,b \ne 0)$ $v(a) \le v(ab)$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Euclidean Domain]
	An integral domain $D$ is a Euclidean Domain if there exists a Euclidean Norm in $D$.
\end{definition}
For example, $v(n) = |n|$ is a Euclidean norm on Euclidean domain $\mathbb{Z}$. And $v(f(x)) = deg(f(x))$ is a Euclidean norm on Euclidean domain $F[x]$.

\begin{theorem}
	Every Euclidean domain is a PID.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $D$ be a Euclidean domain with Euclidean norm $v$.
	Let $N$ be an ideal in $D$.
	If $N = \{ 0\}$, then $N = \generator{0}$ is a principal ideal.\\

	Suppose $N \ne \{ 0 \}$.
	Then there exists $b \in N\ (b \ne 0)$.
	Clearly, $b \in N \implies \generator{b}\subset N$.
	Choose a $b \in N$ such that $v(b)$ is minimal in $N$.\\

	\textbf{Claim : $N = \generator{b}$}\\
	Let $a \in N$.
	Then there exists $q,r \in D$ such that $a = qb + r$ where $r = 0$ or $v(r) < v(b)$.
	Clearly, $r = a-qb \in N$.
	Thus, $r = 0$ since $v(r) < v(b)$ and $v(b)$ is minimal in $N$.
	That is, $a = qb$ or $b|a$ for every $a \in N$.
	Thus, $N \subset \generator{b}$.
	Therefore, $N = \generator{b}$.
	In other words, evey ideal in $D$ is a principal ideal.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	Every Euclidean domain is a UFD.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	We know that, every Euclidean domain is a PID.
	And every PID is a UFD.
	Thus, every Euclidean domain is a UFD.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Arithmetic in Euclidean Domain}
\begin{theorem}
	For a Euclidean domain with Euclidean norm $v$, $v(1)$ is minimal and $u \in D$ is a unit if and only if $v(u) = v(1)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We have, $v(a) \le v(ab)$.
	Take $a = 1$, $v(1) \le v(1b) \implies v(1) \le v(b)$ for every $b \in D$.
	Thus, $v(1)$ is minimal.\\

	Suppose $u$ is a unit with multplicative inverse $u^{-1}$.
	Clearly, $v(1) \le v(u)$ since $u \in D$.
	Take $a = u$ and $b = u^{-1}$.
	Then $v(u) \le v(uu^{-1}) = v(1)$.
	Therefore, for every unit $u \in D$, we have $v(u) = v(1)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[division algorithm]
	Let $D$ be a Euclidean domain with Euclidean norm $v$.
	And $a,b \in D\ (a,b \ne 0)$.
	\begin{align*}
		a = & bq_1 + r_1, \text{ where } r_1 = 0 \text{ or } v(r_1) < v(b)
		\intertext{if $r_1 \ne 0$}
		b = & r_1q + r_2, \text{ where } r_2 = 0 \text{ or } v(r_2) < v(r_1)
		\intertext{ In general, if $r_i \ne 0$}
		r_{i-1} = & r_iq + r_{i+1} \text{ where } r_{i+1} = 0 \text{ or } v(r_{i+1}) < v(r_i)
	\end{align*}
	Then the sequence $r_1,r_2, \dots$ must terminate with some $r_s = 0$.\\

	If $r_1 = 0$, then $gcd(a,b) = b$.\\
	If $r_k = 0$, then $gcd(a,b) = r_{k-1}$.\\

	Furthermore, if $d$ is a gcd of $a$ and $b$, then there exists $\lambda,\mu \in D$ such that $d= \lambda a + \mu b$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	\textbf{Step 1 : Finite Sequence  $r_1,r_2,\dots,r_s$}\\
	Suppose $r_1,r_2,\dots,r_{i-1} \ne 0$.
	Then $v(r_1) > v(r_2) > \dots > v(r_{i-1})$ is a strictly decreasing sequence of non-negative integers.
	Thus, the sequence will terminate in finite numbers of steps.
	That is, $r_s = 0 $ for some integer $s$.\\
	
	\textbf{Step 2 : $gcd(a,b) = r_{s-1}$}\\
	Suppose $r_1 = 0$.
	Then $a = bq$ and $gcd(a,b) = b$ since $b|a, b|b$ and there does not exist an integer greater than $b$ that divides $b$.\\

	Suppose $r_1 \ne 0$ and $gcd(a,b) = d$.
	Then $r_1 = a-bq$ and $d|r_1$.\\
	And $d | b, d | r_1 \implies d|a$ since $a = qb+r_1$.
	Thus, $gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,r_1)$.\\
	Continuing like this, we get $gcd(a,b) = gcd(r_{s-2},r_{s-1})$ if $r_{s-1} \ne 0$.\\
	And we have, $r_s = 0 \implies r_{s-2} = qr_{s-1}$.\\
	Clearly, $gcd(r_{s-2},r_{s-1}) = r_{s-1} = gcd(a,b)$.\\

	\textbf{Step 3 : $gcd(a,b) = \lambda a + \mu b$}\\
	Let $b$ be a $gcd(a,b)$.
	Then, $b = 0a+1b$ and result is complete.\\

	Suppose $gcd(a,b) = r_{s-1}$.
	And $r_{s-1} = r_{s-3} - qr_{s-2}$.
	Clearly, $r_i = \lambda_i r_{i-2} + \mu_i r_{i-1}$.
	Keep on substituting using these equations until we reach $r_{s-1} = \lambda a + \mu b$.\\

	Suppose $d'$ is another $gcd(a,b)$.
	Then $d' = ud$ is an associate of $d$.
	And $d' = ud = (\lambda u)a + (\mu u) b$.
	And the result is true for any $gcd(a,b)$.
\end{proof}

\section{Gaussian Integers and Multiplicative Norms \S47}
\subsection{Gaussian Integers and Norm}
\begin{definition}[Gaussian integers]
	Gaussian integers are complex numbers of the form $a+ib$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$.
\end{definition}
Note : Let $\alpha = a+ib$.
Clearly, Gaussian integers are elements of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.
Here, $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a simple extension of the integral domain $\mathbb{Z}$ with a zero of $x^2+1$.

\begin{definition}[Gaussian Norm]
	Let $\alpha = a+ib$ be a Gaussian integer.
	Then $N(\alpha) = |\alpha|^2 = a^2+b^2$ is a Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	The Gaussian norm $N : \mathbb{Z}[i] \to \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $N(a+ib) = a^2+b^2$ has the following properties
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $N(\alpha) \ge 0,\ \forall \alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$
		\item $N(\alpha) = 0 \iff \alpha = 0$
		\item $N(\alpha\beta) = N(\alpha)N(\beta)$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We have $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$.
	Then $\alpha = a+ib$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$.
	Clearly, $N(a+ib) = a^2+b^2 \ge 0$.\\

	$N(\alpha) = 0 \iff a^2+b^2 = 0 \iff a=0,b=0 \iff \alpha = 0+i0 = 0$.\\

	Also, $N(\alpha\beta) = |\alpha\beta|^2 = |\alpha|^2 |\beta|^2 = N(\alpha)N(\beta)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	$\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is an integral domain.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$.\\
	Then, $\alpha + \beta = (a+ib) + (c+id) = (a+c) + i(b+d) = (c+a) + i(d+b) = \beta + \alpha$.
	And for any $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$, we have $\alpha \cdot 1 = (a+ib) \cdot (1+i0) = (a+ib)$.
	Thus, we have $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a commutative ring with unity.\\

	It remains to prove that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ has no zero divisors.
	Suppose $\alpha\beta = 0$.
	$\alpha\beta = 0 \implies N(\alpha\beta) = 0 \implies N(\alpha) N(\beta) = 0$.
	But, $N(\alpha),N(\beta) \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ has no zero divisors.
	Thus, $N(\alpha) = 0$ or $N(\beta) = 0 \implies \alpha = 0$ or $\beta = 0$.
	Therefore $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ has no zero divisors.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Gaussian integers is a Euclidean Domain]
	The function $v$ defined by $v(\alpha) = N(\alpha)$ for every non-zero $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Euclidean norm.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	\textbf{Step 1 : $v(a) \le v(ab)$}\\
	Let $\beta = b_1 + ib_2$ and $\beta \ne 0$.
	Then $N(\beta) = b_1^2+b_2^2 \ge 1$.
	Thus, $N(\alpha) \le N(\alpha)N(\beta) = N(\alpha\beta)$.\\

	\textbf{Step 2 : Division algorithm}\\
	That is, $\forall \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{Z}[i],(\beta \ne 0)\ \exists \sigma,\rho \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that $\alpha = \beta\sigma+\rho$, and $\rho = 0$ or $v(\rho) < v(\beta)$.

	Since $\beta \ne 0$, $\alpha/\beta$ exists.
	And we have, $\frac{\alpha}{\beta} = \frac{a_1+ia_2}{b_1+ib_2} = \frac{(a_1+ia_2)(b_1-ib_2)}{(b_1+ib_2)(b_1-ib_2)} = \frac{a_1b_1+a_2b_2}{b_1^2+b_2^2} + i \frac{a_2b_1-a_1b_2}{b_1^2+b_2^2} = r+is$ where $r,s \in \mathbb{Q}$.
	Consider integers $q_1,q_2$ that are nearest to the rational numbers $r,s$.
	Define $\sigma = q_1 + iq_2 \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ and $\rho = \alpha - \beta\sigma$.\\

	Suppose $\rho \ne 0$.
	If $\rho = 0$, then the proof is complete.
	By definition of $\sigma$, $|q_1-r| \le 0.5$ and $|q_2-s| \le 0.5$.
	And we have,
	\[ N \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta} - \sigma \right) = N((r-q_1)+i(s-q_2)) = |q_1-r|^2 + |q_2-s|^2 \le 0.5 \]
	Since $\alpha = \beta\sigma + \rho$,
	we have $\rho = \beta(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}-\sigma)$
	\[N(\rho) = N \left( \beta \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}-\sigma \right) \right) = N(\beta) N \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}-\sigma\right) \le 0.5N(\beta)\]
	Thus, $N(\rho) < N(\beta)$.
	Therefore, Gaussian integers is a Euclidean domain.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Multiplicative Norm}
\begin{definition}[multiplicative norm]
	Let $D$ be an integral domain. A function $N : D \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a multiplicative norm if 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $N(\alpha) = 0 \iff \alpha = 0$
		\item $N(\alpha\beta) = N(\alpha)N(\beta),\ \forall \alpha,\beta \in D$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Note : Guassian norm is a multiplicative norm.

\begin{theorem}
	Let $D$ be an integral domain with multiplicative norm $N$.
	Then $N(1) = 1$ and $|N(u)| = 1$ for any unit $u$.
	Suppose $|N(\alpha)| = 1$ only for units  in $D$.
	Then $N(\alpha)$ is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}$ implies $\alpha$ is an irreducible in $D$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We know, $N$ is a multiplicative norm.
	Thus, $N(1) = N(1 \ast 1) = N(1)N(1) \implies N(1) = 1$.\\

	Suppose $u$ is a unit in $D$.
	Then $1 = N(1) = N(uu^{-1}) = N(u) N(u^{-1})$
	Since $1$ has only two factors $\pm 1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have $|N(u)| = 1$.\\

	Suppose $|N(\alpha)| = 1$ only if $\alpha$ is a unit in $D$.
	Suppose $\alpha \in D$ and $|N(\alpha)| = p$, where $p$ is a prime in $\mathbb{Z}$.
	Suppose $\alpha$ is not an irreductible.
	Then $\alpha$ has a factorisation $\alpha = \beta\gamma$ where $\beta,\gamma \in D$ are non-units.
	Then $p = N(\alpha) = N(\beta\gamma) = N(\beta)N(\gamma)$.
	We have, $\beta,\gamma$ are non-units and $|N(\beta)| \ne 1$ and $|N(\gamma)| \ne 1$.
	This is not possible.
	Therefore, $\alpha$ is an irreducible in $D$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Applications of multiplicative norm}
\subsubsection{The integral domain $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a UFD.(\S47.9)}
\begin{proof}
Elements of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ are of the form $a+b\sqrt{-5}$ and $N(a+b\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2$.
If $N(a+b\sqrt{-5}) = a^2+5b^2 = 1$, then, $a = \pm 1$ and $b = 0$.
Clearly, $|N(\alpha)| = 1$ only if $\alpha$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.\\

The element $3 \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is an irreducible.
Suppose $3$ is not an irreducible.
That is, there is a factorisation $3 = \beta\gamma$ where $\beta,\gamma$ are non-units.
Then $9 = N(3) = N(\beta)N(\gamma)$ where $\beta,\gamma$ are non-units.
The integer factors of $9$ are $1,3,9$.
Thus, $N(\beta) = N(\gamma) = 3$.
Otherwise $N(\beta) = 1$ or $N(\gamma) = 1$.
But, there doesn't exist an element $a+b\sqrt{-5}$ such that $N(a+b\sqrt{-5}) = 3$.
Similarly, $7 \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is an irreducible.
We have, $49 = N(7) = N(\beta)N(\gamma) \implies N(\beta)=N(\gamma) = 7$ is not possible since there are no elements of norm $7$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.\\

Suppose $(1+2\sqrt{-5})$ is not an irreducible.
Then, $21 = N(1+2\sqrt{-5}) = N(\beta)N(\gamma)$.
However, we know that the integer factors of $21$ are $1,3,7,21$.
Without loss of generality, we have $N(\beta) = 3$ which is not possible.
Thus, $1+2\sqrt{-5}$ is an irreducible.\\

However neither $3$ nor $7$ is an associate of $1+2\sqrt{-5}$.
Since $|N(1+2\sqrt{-5})| \ne N(3)$ and $N(1+2\sqrt{-5}) \ne N(7)$.
Clearly, the factorisation of $21 \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not unique.
Therefore, $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a UFD.
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Fermat's $p = a^2+b^2$ theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Fermat]
	Let $p$ be an odd prime integer.
	Then $p = a^2 + b^2$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ if and only if $p \cong 1 \pmod{4}$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose there exists an odd prime $p$ such that $p = a^2 + b^2$.
	Then $a,b$ are of different parity.
	Without loss of generality, $a$ is even and $b$ is odd.
	Let $a=2r$ and $b=2s+1$.
	Then $a^2+b^2 = 4r^2 + 4s^2 + 1 \cong 1 \pmod{4}$.\\

	Suppose $p \cong 1 \pmod{4}$.
	Then $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a cyclic group of order $p-1$ which has a element $n$ of order $4$ since $4|(p-1)$.
	Then $n^2 = -1 \in \mathbb{Z}_p$.
	And $n^2+1 \cong 0 \pmod{p}$.
	In other words, $p | (n^2+1)$.\\

	We claim that, $p$ is not an irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.
	Suppose $p$ is an irreducible then $p|(n^2+1) \implies p|(n+i)$ or $p|(n-i)$.
	And $p|(n+i) \implies n+i = p(a+bi) \implies n= pa \text{ and }1 = pb$.
	But, $1=pb$ is not possible.
	Similarly, $p|(n-i) \implies n-i = p(a+bi) \implies -1 = pb$ is also not possible.
	Thus if $p \cong 1 \pmod{4}$, then $p$ is not an irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\\

	Since $p$ is not an irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.
	$p = (a+bi)(c+di)$ where $a+bi,c+di$ are non-units in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.
	Considering the Gaussian norm $N$ on $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ defined by $N(a+bi) = a^2 + b^2$.
	We have, $p^2 = N(p) = N(a+bi)N(c+di) = (a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2)$.
	And $N((a+bi) \ne 1$ since for Gaussian norm $N(\alpha) = 1 \iff \alpha = 1$.
	Similarly, $N(c+di) \ne 1$.
	Therefore, without loss of generality $N(a+bi) = p$ since $a^2+b^2 > 0$.
	In other words, $p = a^2 + b^2$.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Exercise \S47}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We have $5$ is an odd prime and  $5 \cong 1 \mod{4}$.
		Therefore $5$ is not an irreducible Gaussian integer.
		Clearly, $2^2+1^2 = 5 \implies (2+i)(2-i) = 5$.\\

		And $N(2+i) = 5$ is a prime, thus $2+i$ is an irreducible.
		Similarly, $2-i$ is also an irreducible.
		Therefore $5 = (2+i)(2-i)$ is factorisation using irreducibles Gaussian integers.
		(hint : $2^2+1^ = 5$. But, $1 \ast 1 + 2 \ast 2 = 5$)\\

		Note : We have $ 5 = (2+i)(2-i) = (1+2i)(1-2i)$.
		However $5$ has a unique factorisation since $(2+i)$ and $(1-2i)$ are associates $(2+i)(0-i) = 1-2i$ where $-i \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unit with multiplicative inverse $i$.

	\item We have $7$ is an odd prime.
		However $7 \cong 3 \pmod{4}$.
		Therefore $7$ is an irreducible Gaussian integer.
	\item We have $N(4+3i) = 25$.
		Clearly, $(4+3i) = \alpha\beta \implies N(\alpha) = N(\beta) = 5$.
		Therefore, $4+3i = (2-i)(1+2i)$ is a factorisation of $4+3i$.
		(Hint : $2^2+1^2 = 5$. But, $1 \ast 2 + 1 \ast 2 = 4$.)
	\item We have $N(6-7i) = 85 = 5 \ast 17$.
		Clearly $6-7i = (2+i)(1-4i)$.
		(Hint : $2^2+1^2 = 5$ and $4^2+1^2 = 17$. But $1 \ast 2 + 1 \ast 4 = 6$.)
	\item We have $6 = 2 \ast 3$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.
		Then, $N(\alpha\beta) = 4 \implies a^2+5b^2 = 2$ is not possible.
		And, $N(\alpha\beta)= 9 \implies a^2+5b^2 = 3$ is also not possible. Therefore, $6 = 2 \ast 3$ is a factoriation in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.\\

		However $N(\alpha\beta) = 6 \implies a^2 + 5b^2 = 6 \implies |a| = |b| = 1$.
		Clearly, $6 = (1-\sqrt{-5})(1+\sqrt{-5})$ is another factorisation.
