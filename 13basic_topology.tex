%Introduction to topology game
%1. Open set characterisation
%Make four subsets of alphabets
%Letters of your name, and three of your friends names
%Intersection of any two sets - closed under finite intersections
%Union of any two sets - closed under arbitrary union
%2. Closed set characterisation
%Letters not in your name, and three of your friends names
%Union of any two sets - closed under finite unions
%Intersection of any two sets - closed under arbitrary intersections
%3. Neighbourhood Characterisation
%4. Interior Characterisation

%Need to find activities for the following :
%Continuous Function \& Quotient Space
%Compact, Lindeloff - Smallness of a Space
%Connected, Locally Connected, Path Connected
%Separation Axioms

%Need to give reading assignments:
%relevent skipped portions - what we might have missed !?
%other reference books - how they are presenting the same idea ?
%other books - get meaning out of it !
