\section{Lebesgue Measure}
\begin{description}
	\item[set function] A function which maps sets into (extended) real numbers.
	\item[$\sigma$-algebra] A family $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of a nonempty set $X$ such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\mathcal{A}$ contains the empty set, 
		\item $\mathcal{A}$ contains complement of each of its members and
		\item $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under countable unions.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	From these 3 axioms, we can deduce the following,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{3}
		\item $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under countable intersections (by de Morgan's laws).
			$$\left( \bigcup_{k = 1}^\infty E_k^c \right)^c = \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty E_k \in \mathcal{A}$$
		\item $E,F \in \mathcal{A} \implies E-F \in \mathcal{A}$ since $E-F = E \cap F^c$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\begin{definition}[Length of an interval]
	Length is a real valued set function. Let $I$ be a bounded interval say $[a,b)$. Then its length $l(I)=b-a$ is the difference between endpoints.
	If an interval $I$ is unbounded say $(a,\infty)$, then its length, $l(I) = \infty$.
\end{definition}


\subsection{Exercise}
\subsubsection{Techniques in Measure Theory}
	Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a $\sigma$-algebra. Let Lebesgue Measure $m : \mathcal{A} \to [0,\infty]$ be countably additive over disjoint collection of sets in $\mathcal{A}$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lebesgue Measure $m$ has monotonicity.\\
		$A \subseteq B \implies B = A \cup (B-A)$ is a disjoint union \\
		$\implies m(B) = m(A) + m(B-A) \ge m(A)$
	\item If exists $E \in \mathcal{A}$ such that $m(E) < \infty$, then $m(\phi) = 0$\\
		Suppose $m(\phi) = c$ and $m(E) = k$ where $k < \infty$. If $c \ne 0$, then $m(E \cup \phi) = m(E) + m(\phi) = c+k > k = m(E)$ is a contradiction.
	\item $m\left(\cup_{k=1}^\infty E_k\right) \le \sum_{k=1}^\infty m(E_k)$\\
		Define $\{ F_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \}$ by $F_k = E_k - \cup_{j = 1}^{k-1} E_j$\\
		Then $F_1 = E_1$, $F_2 = E_2 - E_1$, $F_3 = E_3 - (E_1 \cup E_2)$, \dots\\
		Also $F_k \in \mathcal{A}$ and $F_k \subseteq E_k,\ \forall k \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus $m(F_k) \le m(E_k),\ \forall k$
		However, $\cup_{k=1}^\infty E_k = \cup_{k=1}^\infty F_k$\\
		$\implies m\left( \cup_{k=1}^\infty E_k \right) = m \left( \cup_{k=1}^\infty F_k \right) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty m(F_k) \le \sum_{k=1}^\infty m(E_k)$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Counting Measure}
	The counting measure $c : \mathcal{A} \to [0,\infty]$ is a set function which maps sets to their cardinality. For example, if $E = \{2,3,4\}$, then $c(E) = 3$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The counting measure is \textbf{translation invariant} since translation never increases the cardinality of the set.\\
		For example, $5+E = \{7,8,9\}$. And $m(5+E) = 3 = m(E)$.
	\item The counting measure is \textbf{countably additive} over disjoint collections since the cardinality of disjoint union of two sets is the sum of their cardinalities.
	\item However, counting measure of (non-degenerate) intervals are $\infty$ which is \textbf{not the same as their length} for bounded intervals.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lebesgue Outer Measure}
\begin{description}
	\item[$G_\delta$] A set which is countable intersection of open subsets.
	\item[$F_\sigma$] A set which is countable union of closed subsets.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Set-theoretic Construction of Lebesgue Measure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Construct Lebesgue Outer Measure $m^\ast$ (with Axiom 3 relaxed) \\
		ie, Obtain the underlying relation of the set function
	\item Restrict $m^\ast$ to the $\sigma$-algebra of our interest \\
		ie, Choose a domain so that set function is well defined.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{definition}[Lebesgue Outer Measure]
	Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$. Let $\mathcal{C} = \{ I_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ be an open cover of $A$ such that $I_k$ are non-empty, bounded, open intervals. Consider the sum of length of intervals for such covers of $A$. (Lebesgue) Outer Measure $m^\ast(A)$ is the infimum of all such sums.
	$$ m^\ast(A) = \inf \left\{ \sum_{k=1}^\infty l(I_k) : A \subset \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k \right\} $$
\end{definition}
\subsection{Properties of Lebesgue Outer Measure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Outer Measure of the empty set is zero\\
		Let $\epsilon > 0$. Then $\mathcal{C}_\epsilon = \{ (0,\frac{\epsilon}{2^n}) : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ is an open cover of $\phi$ containing nonempty, bounded, open intervals. Clearly, sum of length of intervals in $C_\epsilon = \epsilon$. Suppose $m^\ast(\phi) = \delta$ and $\delta > 0$. There exists $\epsilon$ such that $0 < \epsilon < \delta$. The sum of intervals of $\mathcal{C}_\epsilon$ is less than $\delta$, which is a contradiction by the definition of Outer Measure.
	\item Outer Measure is monotone\\
		Suppose $A \subset B$. Then every cover of $B$ is also an  cover of $A$. Let $\mathcal{U}$ be the set of all open covers of $A$ with nonempty, bounded intervals and $\mathcal{V}$ be the set of all such open covers of $A$. Clearly, $\mathcal{V} \subset \mathcal{U}$. We know that, if $A \subset B$, then $\inf{B} \le \inf{A}$. Therefore,
	\begin{equation}
		A \subset B \implies m^\ast(A) \le m^\ast(B)
	\end{equation}
	\item Outer Measure of Countable Sets is zero
	\item Outer Measure of an Interval is its length
	\begin{proof}
		\textbf{Case 1 : Closed, Bounded Interval}
		Let $[a,b]$ be a closed, bounded interval. Then for any $\epsilon > 0$, $(a-\epsilon,b+\epsilon)$ is a cover of $[a,b]$. Thus, by the definition of outer measure $m^\ast([a,b]) \le b-a+2\epsilon$ since $[a,b] \subset (a-\epsilon,b+\epsilon)$ and $m^\ast$ is monotonic. Therefore,
	\begin{equation}
		m^\ast([a,b]) \le b-a
	\end{equation}

		Since $[a,b]$ is closed and bounded, $[a,b]$ is compact. And by Heine-Borel theorem, every open cover of $[a,b]$ has a finite subcover. Thus, it is sufficient to prove the theorem for finite covers of $[a,b]$.\\

		Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a finite cover of $[a,b]$ with $n$ open intervals. Let $(a_1,b_1)$ be an open interval containing $a$ in $\mathcal{C}$. Then $a_1 < a < b_1$. If $b_1 > b$ then $l(a_1,b_1) > l(a,b)$. And $\sum_{i=1}^k l(I_k) \ge l(a_1,b_1) \ge b-a$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw (-3,0) -- (3,0);
	\draw[blue] (-1.5,0.1) -- (1.5,0.1);
	\draw (-1,0) circle (0.05cm);
	\draw (-1,-0.5) node{$a$};
	\draw (1,0) circle (0.05cm);

	\draw (1.5,0) circle (0.05cm);
	\draw (1.5,-0.5) node{$b_1$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

		Suppose $b_1 < b$. Clearly, $a < b_1$. And the cover $\mathcal{C}$ must have an open interval containing $b_1$. Otherwise $\mathcal{C}$ is not a cover of $[a,b]$. That is, there exists $(a_2,b_2)$ containing $b_1 \in (a,b)$ such that $a_2 < b_1 < b_2$. If $b_2 > b$, then $\sum_{i=1}^k l(I_k) \ge l(a_1,b_1) + l(a_2,b_2) \ge l(a_1,b_2) \ge b-a$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw (-3,0) -- (3,0);
	\draw (-1,0) circle (0.05cm);
	\draw (-1,-0.5) node{$a$};
	\draw (1,0) circle (0.05cm);
	\draw (1,-0.5) node{$b$};

	\draw (-1.5,0) circle (0.05cm);
	\draw (-1.5,-0.5) node{$a_1$};
	\draw (0.5,0) circle (0.05cm);
	\draw (0.5,-0.5) node{$b_1$};
	\draw[blue] (-1.5,0.1) -- (0.5,0.1);

	\draw (0,0) circle (0.05cm);

	\draw (1.5,-0.5) node{$b_2$};
	\draw[red] (0,0.2) -- (1.5,0.2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

		Suppose $b_2 < b$. Continuing like this we get, $N$ open intervals in $\mathcal{C}$, $\{ (a_k,b_k) : k = 1,2,\cdots,N \} $ such that $a_1 < a < b_1$ and $a_N < b < b_N$ and $a_k < b_{k-1} < b_k$ for all $k$. The process should terminate in fintie steps as $\mathcal{C}$ is a finite cover of $[a,b]$. Then $\sum_{k=1}^N l(I_k) \ge \sum_{k=1}^N l(a_k,b_k) \ge l(a_1,b_N) \ge b-a$.

	\draw (-1,0) circle (0.05cm);
	\draw (-1,-0.5) node{$b_3$};
	\draw[blue] (-2.5,0.1) -- (-1,0.1);
	
	\draw (-1.5,0) circle (0.05cm);
	\draw (-1.5,-0.5) node{$a_4$};
	\draw[red,dashed] (-1.5,0.2) -- (0.5,0.2);

	\draw (2.5,0) circle (0.05cm);
	\draw (2.5,-0.5) node{$b_{N-2}$};
	\draw[blue,dashed] (0.5,0.1) -- (2.5,0.1);

	\draw (6,-0.5) node{$b_N$};
	\draw[blue] (3.5,0.1) -- (6,0.1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

	Clearly, every open cover of $[a,b]$ contains a finite subcover $\mathcal{C}$, which contains a finite subcover of the form $\{ (a_k,b_k) : k=1,2,\cdots,N \}$ such that $\sum_{k=1}^N l(I_k) \ge b-a$. Thus, for any open cover $\sum_{k=1}^\infty l(I_k) \ge b-a$. And thus,
	\begin{equation}
		m^\ast([a,b]) \ge b-a
	\end{equation}

	\textbf{Case 2 : Unbounded Interval}
	
	\end{proof}
	\item Outer Measure is translation invariant
	\item Outer Measure is countably subadditive
